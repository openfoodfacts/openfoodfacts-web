   <p>We are excited to announce&nbsp;<strong>the launch of new Nutri-Score on Open Food Facts</strong>, the first major upgrade of the nutritional labelling system.</p>
   <p>This is available today on our Open Food Facts mobile app for Android and iPhone, as well as on our website, in line with a long tradition of pioneering firsts.</p>

    <strong>What is the Nutri-Score?</strong>
</h2>

<p>The Nutri-Score is a logo that aims to inform you about the nutritional quality of food.&nbsp;The color code ranges from dark green (A) for the healthiest products to dark red (E) for the least healthy.</p>

<h2 class="title-2 emphasized-title">
    <strong><strong>Why is Nutri-Score changing?</strong></strong>
</h2>

            <img width="400px" src="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/images/misc/new-nutriscore/Nutri-Score%20facts%20-%20EN.png" alt="Nutri-Score facts">
            <img width="400px" src="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/images/misc/new-nutriscore/Why%20a%20new%20algorithm%20-%20EN.png" alt="Why a new algorithm">
<p>The Nutri-Score formula is evolving to provide better recommendations:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Better evaluate all drinks</strong>&nbsp;The comparative scores of milk,&nbsp;sweetened dairy drinks,&nbsp;and plant-based drinks have been better differentiated in the new algorithm.</li>
   <li><strong>Better ranking of drinks</strong>&nbsp;Sugar content is better taken into account and favors low-sugar drinks.&nbsp;Sweeteners will also be penalized:&nbsp;diet sodas will be downgraded from a B rating to between C and E.&nbsp;Water remains the recommended drink.</li>
   <li><strong>Salt and sugar penalized</strong>&nbsp;Products that are too sweet or too salty will see their rating further downgraded.</li>
   <li><strong>Prioritization of oils and fish</strong>&nbsp;The rating of some fatty fish and oils rich in good fats will improve.</li>
   <li><strong>Limit red meat</strong>&nbsp;Red meat consumption should be limited.&nbsp;This is why poultry will be comparatively better ranked.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="title-2 emphasized-title">
    <strong>How to differentiate between old Nutri-Score and new calculation?</strong>
</h2>

<p>From now on,&nbsp;the logo can display a &quot;New calculation&quot; mention to clarify that it is indeed the new calculation.</p>

<h2 class="title-2 emphasized-title"><strong>Where to find the new Nutri-Score calculation?</strong></h2>
<p>Nutri-Score is in use in 7 countries: France&nbsp;Germany,&nbsp;Belgium,&nbsp;Spain,&nbsp;Luxembourg,&nbsp;the Netherlands,&nbsp;and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Manufacturers have at most 2 years at the latest after the signature of the decree to replace the old calculation with the new one.</p>
<p>Without waiting,&nbsp;you can already find the new calculation in the Open Food Facts application,&nbsp;even if the manufacturers have not updated the score.</p>

<h2 class="title-2 emphasized-title"><strong>What does not change</strong></h2>
<p>Nutri-Score is a score designed to measure nutritional quality.&nbsp;It is complementary to the NOVA group on ultra-processed foods (also present in the application).</p>
<p>In France, the new computation of the Nutri-Score is legally in force since the signature of the "Arrêté" in March 2025. The new computation will then progressively arrive on the product packagings, within 2 years..
<p>For manufacturers, the display of Nutri-Score remains optional.</p>

<h2 class="title-2 emphasized-title">The algorithm is evolving to be more in line with dietary recommendations</h2>
<p><em>"This new algorithm will enhance the effectiveness of the Nutri-score in classifying foods and drinks, in line with the main dietary recommendations of European countries, and guide consumers towards informed choices that are good for their health"&nbsp;</em>explains the French Directorate-General for Health.</p>
<p><strong>✅ Strengthened criterion</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The European scientific commitee of the Nutri-Score <strong>reviewed the algorithm</strong>&nbsp;used to calculate the Nutri-Score, to better reflect the nutritional quality of products.
    <strong>30% to 40% of products have a changed score.</strong></p>
<p><strong>✅&nbsp;</strong><strong>Distinctive banner for new calculation</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nutri-Score logo can how have&nbsp;<strong>a distinctive banner</strong>&nbsp;indicating that it has been calculated using&nbsp;<strong>the new formula</strong>.
    While the banner is not mandatory on packs, it provides assurance that the Nutri-Score has been calculated with the new algorithm.</p>

<p>We believe that new Nutri-Score is&nbsp;<strong>a valuable tool</strong>&nbsp;for consumers, food manufacturers, and retailers alike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It provides:</p>
<p><strong>✔ a clear and concise summary of the nutritional quality</strong>&nbsp;of products,&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>✔&nbsp;</strong>helping consumers make informed choices</p>
<p><strong>✔&nbsp;</strong>encouraging food manufacturers to improve the nutritional profile of their products.</p>
