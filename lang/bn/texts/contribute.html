Open Food Facts exists thanks to the citizens who give their time and talent in many different activities.

We are a large international family that gives a unique character to this beautiful project, made for all, by all! üåç‚ú® 
		</p>
		<p>
To facilitate the involvement of our contributors and allow the project to grow in a more dynamic way, we are setting up a Contributors Skill Pool, as well as teams of volunteers by theme.
		</p>
		<p>
‚úÖ The aim is to match your skills and interests to the needs of the project.

		<p>Developing Open Beauty Facts also requires specialized knowledge and expertise in many different areas:</p>

		<h3>‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ï‡¶≤‡ßç‡¶™ ‡¶™‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶≤‡¶®‡¶æ</h3>
		<p>We have tons of ideas and you probably have even more, but it is quite a challenge to prioritize them, to build a roadmap, and to manage projects when every participant is a volunteer with often limited time available.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>‡¶®‡¶ï‡¶∂‡¶æ</h3>
		<p>We need help to build a better user experience on the Open Food Facts web site and mobile app, to improve their design, to create impactful presentation materials etc.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>Development</h3>
		<p>We have a <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/development">lot of development work to do</a>. On the Open Food Facts backend (Perl and MongoDB), API (JSON), web site (templatized HTML5, JS, Foundation), our <a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app">Flutter mobile app for iOS and Android</a>, but also to build new cool reuses etc. We have SDK projects in many programming languages to ensure anyone can reuse and contribute to Open Food Facts, in any language. We also have a growing Artificial Intelligence effort to simplify contribution work. Our code is on <a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts">GitHub</a>.
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>Community building</h3>
		<p>We need to build local communities in all countries and at the same time unite them globally.</p>
		<p>It is very difficult to bootstrap a local community in a country without living there, so your help to find the first very motivated participants is essential. Are you one of them?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Communication</h3>
		<p>We are not sure what to write here, could you help?</p>
		<p>More seriously, there are lot of cool things that users, contributors and reusers do with Open Food Facts, it would be great to get more people to know about it. In particular, we need help for public and <a href="/press">media relations</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Special projects</h3>
<p>There are lots of interesting and original applications of food open data that we could work on with government food agencies, food producers, researchers, universities, schools, NGOs etc. Maybe you already have ideas? If you do, please help us to push them forward.</p></li>

You can even help add a food category or a label that is not yet supported by Open Food Facts.</p>
