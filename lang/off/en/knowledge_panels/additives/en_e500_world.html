<p>Sodium carbonates (E500) are compounds commonly used in food preparation
as leavening agents, helping baked goods rise by releasing carbon dioxide
when they interact with acids.</p>
<p>Often found in baking soda, they regulate the pH of food, preventing it
from becoming too acidic or too alkaline. In the culinary world, sodium
carbonates can also enhance the texture and structure of foods, such as
noodles, by modifying the gluten network.</p>
<p>Generally recognized as safe, sodium carbonates are non-toxic when
consumed in typical amounts found in food.</p>
