<p>Diphosphates (E450) are food additives often utilized to modify the
texture of products, acting as leavening agents in baking and preventing
the coagulation of canned food.</p>
<p>These salts can stabilize whipped cream and are also found in powdered
products to maintain their flow properties. They are commonly present in
baked goods, processed meats, and soft drinks.</p>
<p>Derived from phosphoric acid, <strong>they're part of our daily phosphate
intake, which often surpasses recommended levels</strong> due to the prevalence
of phosphates in processed foods and drinks.</p>
<p>Excessive phosphate consumption is linked to health issues, such as
<strong>impaired kidney function</strong> and <strong>weakened bone health</strong>. Though diphosphates
are generally regarded as safe when consumed within established
acceptable daily intakes, it's imperative to monitor overall phosphate
consumption to maintain optimal health.</p>
