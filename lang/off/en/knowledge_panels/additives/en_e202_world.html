<p>Potassium sorbate (E202) is a synthetic food preservative commonly used
to extend the shelf life of various food products.</p>
<p>It works by inhibiting the growth of molds, yeast, and some bacteria,
preventing spoilage. When added to foods, it helps maintain their
freshness and quality.</p>
<p>Some studies have shown that when combined with nitrites, potassium
sorbate have genotoxic activity in vitro.</p>
<p><strong>Two recent large-scale epidemiological studies (NutriNet-Santé cohort, 2025)</strong> have suggested links between its consumption and increased risks of chronic diseases:
* A <strong>14% increase in overall cancer incidence and 26% increase in breast cancer</strong> was observed in highest consumers compared to non-consumers.
* A <strong>115% increase in type 2 diabetes risk</strong> was observed in highest consumers compared to lowest consumers.</p>
<p>These results require confirmation by other studies, but are consistent with experimental work on potential mechanisms (microbiota disruption, oxidative stress).</p>
