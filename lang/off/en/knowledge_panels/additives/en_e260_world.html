<p>Acetic acid (E260), also known as vinegar, is a natural preservative and acidulant widely used in the food industry.</p>
<p>It is widely present in fats and sauces (dressings, condiments), as well as in processed meats, dairy preparations, and prepared dishes.</p>
<p><strong>Two recent large-scale epidemiological studies (NutriNet-Santé cohort, 2025)</strong> have suggested links between high consumption and increased risks of chronic diseases:
* A <strong>12% increase in overall cancer incidence</strong> was observed in highest consumers.
* A <strong>31% increase in type 2 diabetes risk</strong> was observed in highest consumers compared to lowest consumers.</p>
<p>While these results require confirmation, acetic acid is generally recognized as safe when used in moderation in foods.</p>
