<p>Monosodium glutamate (MSG), or E621, is the sodium salt of glutamic
acid, an amino acid found naturally in many foods.</p>
<p>It is widely used as a flavor enhancer to provide an "umami" or savory
taste to a variety of processed foods, including soups, snack chips, and
frozen meals.</p>
<p>MSG is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by food authorities. However,
some people report sensitivity to MSG, experiencing short-term symptoms
like headaches and flushing, though <strong>scientific studies have not shown a
consistent link</strong>.</p>
