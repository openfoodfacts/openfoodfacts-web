<p>Alpha-tocopherol (E307), a form of vitamin E, is a natural antioxidant used in the food industry.</p>
<p>It is added to foods to prevent fat oxidation and extend shelf life, particularly in oils, margarines, baked goods, and cereals.</p>
<p><strong>A recent large-scale epidemiological study (NutriNet-Santé cohort, 2025)</strong> suggested a link between high consumption of alpha-tocopherol as a food additive and a <strong>30% increase in type 2 diabetes risk</strong> in highest consumers compared to lowest consumers.</p>
<p>While vitamin E is essential for health, these results suggest that its use as a food additive may require re-evaluation. Alpha-tocopherol naturally present in foods remains beneficial for health.</p>
