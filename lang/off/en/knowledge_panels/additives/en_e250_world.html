<p>Sodium nitrite (E250) is a salt used for curing and preserving meat
products.</p>
<p>It plays a critical role in preventing the growth of Clostridium
botulinum, the bacterium responsible for botulism, in cured meats like
bacon, ham, and sausages. It also provides the characteristic pink color
and flavor.</p>
<p>However, nitrites can react with amines in the stomach to form
nitrosamines, which are <strong>potent carcinogens</strong>. High intake of processed
meats containing nitrites is associated with an <strong>increased risk of
colorectal cancer</strong>. Regulatory bodies have set strict limits on its
use in food.</p>
