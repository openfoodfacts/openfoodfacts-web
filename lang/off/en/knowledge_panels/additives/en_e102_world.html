<p>Tartrazine (E102) is a synthetic lemon-yellow azo dye used as a food
coloring.</p>
<p>It is found in a wide range of products such as soft drinks, desserts,
candies, and snack foods to give them a vibrant yellow appearance.</p>
<p>While approved by many regulatory agencies, tartrazine has been linked
to <strong>allergic reactions</strong>, such as hives, in a small portion of the
population. Some studies have also suggested a link to <strong>increased
hyperactivity in children</strong>, particularly when consumed with other
additives like benzoates.</p>
