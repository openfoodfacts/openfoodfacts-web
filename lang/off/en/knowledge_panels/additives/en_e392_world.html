<p>Rosemary extracts (E392) are natural antioxidants derived from the rosemary plant.</p>
<p>They are used in the food industry to prevent fat oxidation and extend the shelf life of various products, particularly oils, margarines, meats, and baked goods.</p>
<p><strong>A recent large-scale epidemiological study (NutriNet-Santé cohort, 2025)</strong> suggested a link between high consumption of rosemary extracts as a food additive and a <strong>20% increase in type 2 diabetes risk</strong> in highest consumers compared to lowest consumers.</p>
<p>While rosemary is a plant beneficial for health when consumed naturally, these results suggest that its concentrated use as a food additive may require re-evaluation.</p>
