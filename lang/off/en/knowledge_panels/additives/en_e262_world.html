<p>Sodium acetates (E262) are preservatives and acidity regulators used in the food industry.</p>
<p>They are commonly added to processed meats, baked goods, snacks, and prepared dishes to extend shelf life and control pH.</p>
<p><strong>A recent large-scale epidemiological study (NutriNet-Santé cohort, 2025)</strong> suggested a link between high consumption of sodium acetates and a <strong>23% increase in type 2 diabetes risk</strong> in highest consumers compared to lowest consumers.</p>
<p>While these results require confirmation by other studies, sodium acetates are generally recognized as safe by health agencies when used within regulatory limits.</p>
