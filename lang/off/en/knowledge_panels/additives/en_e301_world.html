<p>Sodium ascorbate (E301) is an antioxidant and preservative used in the food industry.</p>
<p>It is added to various products to prevent oxidation and maintain color and freshness, particularly in processed meats, beverages, and baked goods.</p>
<p><strong>A recent large-scale epidemiological study (NutriNet-Santé cohort, 2025)</strong> suggested a link between high consumption of sodium ascorbate and a <strong>41% increase in type 2 diabetes risk</strong> in highest consumers compared to lowest consumers.</p>
<p>While these results require confirmation by other studies, sodium ascorbate is generally recognized as safe by health agencies when used within regulatory limits.</p>
