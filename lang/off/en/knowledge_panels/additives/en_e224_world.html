<p>Potassium metabisulfite (E224) is a preservative and antioxidant used in the food industry.</p>
<p>It is commonly added to alcoholic beverages (responsible for 85.4% of sulfite intake), as well as to industrial sauces to prevent oxidation and deterioration.</p>
<p><strong>Two recent large-scale epidemiological studies (NutriNet-Santé cohort, 2025)</strong> have suggested links between its consumption and increased risks of chronic diseases:

* A <strong>29% increase in type 2 diabetes risk</strong> was observed in highest consumers.</p>
