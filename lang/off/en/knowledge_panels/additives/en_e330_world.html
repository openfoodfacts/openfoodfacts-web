<p>Citric acid is a natural organic acid found in citrus fruits such as
lemons, oranges, and limes.</p>
<p>It is widely used in the food industry as a flavor enhancer, acidulant,
and preservative due to its tart and refreshing taste.</p>
<p><strong>A recent large-scale epidemiological study (NutriNet-Santé cohort, 2025)</strong> suggested a link between high consumption and a <strong>29% increased risk of type 2 diabetes</strong> in highest consumers compared to lowest consumers.</p>
<p>While these results require confirmation, citric acid is safe for consumption when used in moderation and is considered a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) food additive by regulatory agencies worldwide.</p>
