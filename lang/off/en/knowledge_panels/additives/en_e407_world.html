<p>Carrageenan (E407), derived from red seaweed, is widely employed in the
food industry as a gelling, thickening, and stabilizing agent, notably in
dairy and meat products.</p>
<p>It can exist in various forms, each imparting distinct textural
properties to food.</p>
<p>However, its degraded form, often referred to as poligeenan, <strong>has raised
health concerns</strong> due to its potential inflammatory effects and its
classification as a <strong>possible human carcinogen (Group 2B)</strong> by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, food-grade carrageenan has been deemed safe by various
regulatory bodies when consumed in amounts typically found in food.</p>
