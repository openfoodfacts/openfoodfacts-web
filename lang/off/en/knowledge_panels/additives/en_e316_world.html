<p>Sodium erythorbate (E316) is a synthetic antioxidant frequently used in the food industry.</p>
<p>It is commonly added to processed meats (which contributed to 42.3% of intake in the NutriNet-Santé cohort) to prevent oxidation, maintain color, and extend shelf life.</p>
<p><strong>Two recent large-scale epidemiological studies (NutriNet-Santé cohort, 2025)</strong> have suggested links between its consumption and increased risks of chronic diseases:
* A <strong>12% increase in overall cancer incidence and 21% increase in breast cancer</strong> was observed in highest consumers.
* A <strong>43% increase in type 2 diabetes risk</strong> was observed in highest consumers compared to lowest consumers.</p>
<p>These results require confirmation by other studies, but are consistent with experimental work suggesting mechanisms of oxidation, oxidative stress, and inflammation.</p>
