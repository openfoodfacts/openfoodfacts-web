<p>Calcium propionate (E282) is a food preservative used primarily in bakery products.</p>
<p>It works by inhibiting the growth of molds and certain bacteria, thereby extending the shelf life of bread, cakes, and pastries.</p>
<p><strong>A recent large-scale epidemiological study (NutriNet-Santé cohort, 2025)</strong> suggested a link between high consumption of calcium propionate and a <strong>44% increase in type 2 diabetes risk</strong> in highest consumers compared to lowest consumers.</p>
<p>While these results require confirmation by other studies, calcium propionate is generally recognized as safe by health agencies. Experimental studies have suggested it may alter insulin signaling and disrupt the gut microbiota.</p>
