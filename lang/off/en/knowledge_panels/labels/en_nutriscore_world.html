<li>***What it is: Nutri-Score is a front-of-pack (FOP) nutrition labeling system designed to provide an easily understandable assessment of the overall nutritional quality of food products at a glance. It employs a five-color, five-letter scale ranging from A (dark green) for the most nutritionally favorable products to E (red) for the least favorable. Developed by the French scientific team EREN, its primary aim is to help consumers compare the nutritional value of foods within the same category and encourage healthier food choices. Originating in France, it has been officially adopted (often on a voluntary basis) by several other European countries and is used by numerous food manufacturers. This label is the Nutri-Score we detected on the pack. More at https://world-off.openfoodfacts.org/nutriscore</li>
