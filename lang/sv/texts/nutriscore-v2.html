<div>
   <p>We are excited to announce&nbsp;<strong>the launch of Nutri-Score v2 on Open Food Facts</strong>, the first major upgrade of the nutritional labelling system.</p>
   <p>This is available today on our Open Food Facts mobile app for Android and iPhone, as well as on our website, in line with a long tradition of pioneering firsts.</p>
</div>
<h1 class="title-2 emphasized-title"><strong>Vad är Nutri-Score?</strong></h1>
<p>Nutri-Score is a logo that aims to inform you about the nutritional quality of food.&nbsp;The color code ranges from dark green (A) for the healthiest products to dark red (E) for the least healthy.</p>
<a class="button round secondary small" href="/nutriscore">Read our explanation page about the Nutri-Score</a>
<h1 class="title-2 emphasized-title"><strong>Why is Nutri-Score changing?</strong></h1>
<p>The Nutri-Score formula is evolving to provide better recommendations:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Better evaluate all drinks</strong>The comparative scores of milk,&nbsp;sweetened dairy drinks,&nbsp;and plant-based drinks have been better differentiated in the new algorithm.</li>
   <li><strong>Better ranking of drinks</strong>Sugar content is better taken into account and favors low-sugar drinks.&nbsp;Sweeteners will also be penalized:&nbsp;diet sodas will be downgraded from a B rating to between C and E.&nbsp;Water remains the recommended drink.</li>
   <li><strong>Salt and sugar penalized</strong>Products that are too sweet or too salty will see their rating further downgraded.</li>
   <li><strong>Prioritization of oils and fish</strong>The rating of some fatty fish and oils rich in good fats will improve.</li>
   <li><strong>Limit red meat</strong>Red meat consumption should be limited.&nbsp;This is why poultry will be comparatively better ranked.</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="title-2 emphasized-title"><strong>How to differentiate between old Nutri-Score and new calculation?</strong></h1>
<p>From now on,&nbsp;the logo can display a &quot;New calculation&quot; mention to clarify that it is indeed the new calculation.</p>
<h1 class="title-2 emphasized-title"><strong>Where to find the new Nutri-Score calculation?</strong></h1>
<p>Nutri-Score is in use in several countries:&nbsp;Germany,&nbsp;Belgium,&nbsp;Spain,&nbsp;France,&nbsp;Luxembourg,&nbsp;the Netherlands,&nbsp;and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Manufacturers have until 2026 at the latest to replace the old calculation with the new one.</p>
<p>Without waiting,&nbsp;you can already find the new calculation in the Open Food Facts application,&nbsp;even if the manufacturers have not updated the score.</p>
<h1 class="title-2 emphasized-title"><strong>What does not change</strong></h1>
<p>Nutri-Score is a score designed to measure nutritional quality.&nbsp;It is complementary to the NOVA group on ultra-processed foods (also present in the application).</p>
<p>For manufacturers, the display of Nutri-Score remains optional.</p>
<h1 class="title-2 emphasized-title">The algorithm is evolving to be more in line with dietary recommendations</h1>
<p><em>"This new algorithm will enhance the effectiveness of the Nutri-score in classifying foods and drinks, in line with the main dietary recommendations of European countries, and guide consumers towards informed choices that are good for their health"&nbsp;</em>explains the French Directorate-General for Health.</p>
<p><strong>✅ Strengthened criterion</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EREN* scientific team has completely&nbsp;<strong>reviewed the algorithm</strong>&nbsp;used to calculate the Nutri-Score, resulting in more scores that better reflect the nutritional quality of products,&nbsp;<strong>with many of them losing a grade</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>✅&nbsp;</strong><strong>Distinctive banner for new calculation</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nutri-Score v2 will have&nbsp;<strong>a distinctive banner</strong>&nbsp;indicating that it has been calculated using&nbsp;<strong>the new formula</strong>. While the banner is not mandatory on packs, it provides assurance that the Nutri-Score has been correctly calculated.</p>
