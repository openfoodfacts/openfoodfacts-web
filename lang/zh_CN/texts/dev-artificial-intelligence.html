		<h3>The Robotoff collaborative annotation platform</h3>
		<p>While Open Food Facts itself is a large collaborative annotation platform, our latest effort, Robotoff, takes this a step further to turn images into actionable insights than can be applied by a machine or human decision.

		<h3>Robotoff</h3>
		<p>
		Robotoff 可以分析照片，并且根据图片中食品信息的确定性自行编辑 Open Food Facts，或者向人类提出有关食品信息的问题以进行验证。

		<h3>What technologies ?</h3>
		<p>
		We have a very pragmatic approach to AI. The same problem can be solved by various techniques, depending on the data we already have for a specific product. Also, sometimes classic techniques like REGEX achieve the same result as sophisticated networks. So whether you're into NLP, CNN, Vision or anything else, there's likely an impact you can have.

		<h3>Why Open Food Facts ?</h3>
		<p>
		If you are interested in Data science, computer vision, and artificial intelligence in general, Open Food Facts is a fantastic playground. We have a very large annotated datasets, users to ensure initial and continuous learning for the models, and a crack, agile AI volunteer team. Your model will be deployed in weeks, not months or years.
