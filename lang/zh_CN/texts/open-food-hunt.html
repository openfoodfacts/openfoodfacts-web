<p id="description">On <a href=" https://opendataday.org/">Open Data Day</a> - 
the free and open food products database <a href="https://openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a> is launching <b>Open Food Hunt</b>,
an operation to open food products data from as many different countries as possible.</p>

<div style="float:left;margin-right:20px;margin-bottom:20px;width:320px;">
<a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/countries"><img src="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/images/misc/world-map-2015-02.320x167.png" width="320" height="167" alt="Open Food Facts countries map" /></a>
</div>


<p>15.000 contributors have added 660.000 products on Open Food Facts. 
The database includes products from <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/countries">more than 100 different countries</a>, but the bulk of them comes from France - where Open Food Facts was launched in 2012 -
and from a few countries like Spain, the UK, the US and Belgium where we have some very motivated contributors.
Open Food Hunt aims to change that: we are going to add products from the 150 missing countries and try to reach a critical mass of products from as many countries as possible.
Of even greater importance, <b>Open Food Hunt aims to create and develop strong local communities of contributors</b>.</p>

<h3>开放数据日</h3>

<p><em>Food is a great way to "show and tell" people about open data</em></p>
</div>

<blockquote style="font-style:italic">“开放数据日是世界各地城市居民的聚会，他们使用开放的公共数据编写应用程序，数据库，创建可视化效果并发布分析，以表示支持和鼓励世界各个地区和国家政府实行开放数据政策。”
</blockquote>

<p>尽管大多数开放数据来自政府和公共机构，但一些非常有用的数据也是群众收集的（由个人收集） 
例如用于创建 <a href="https://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>的数据。
Food products data in Open Food Facts is aso crowdsourced by contributors who use their smartphones to scan product barcodes and to take pictures of products, ingredients lists and nutrition facts.</p>

<p><b>Food is something every human being is interested in</b>, and open food data can be a very good introduction to open data, as it is useful to everyone (e.g. to decode labels, to compare products, to eat better, and to play !). We hope Open Food Facts and Open Food Hunt will be presented in many Open Data Day gatherings. If you are organizing an Open Data Day event in your city, we have some slides available online and we would be very happy to exchange with you, so please get in touch! We hope Open Food Facts and Open Food Hunt will be presented in many Open Data Day gatherings. 如果您要在所在城市举办开放数据日活动，我们可以在线提供一些幻灯片，我们非常乐意与您交流，因此请与我们保持联系！</p>

<h3 style="clear:right">Open Food Explorers and Open Food Ambassadors</h3>

<p>Starting on Open Data Day and for one week, Open Food Facts contributors will become <b>Open Food Explorers</b>: their goal will be to add as many products from their country on Open Food Facts and to make it reach the next level: from no product to one product, from 1 to 10, 10 to 100, 100 to 1000, 1000 to 10000... (and for people in France we have a special goal to go from 400.000 to 500.000!).</p>

<p>Existing and new contributors will also be invited to become <b>Open Food Ambassadors</b> who recruit new contributors, both in their country and outside their country. In particular ambassadors are highly encouraged to present Open Food Facts to their family and friends living in countries where we currently have no or few products.
