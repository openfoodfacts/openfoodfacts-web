<h1>Nova groups for food processing</h1>

<h2>A classification in 4 groups to highlight the degree of processing of foods</h2>

<p>In the report "The UN Decade of Nutrition, the NOVA food classification and the trouble with ultra-processing" (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/un-decade-of-nutrition-the-nova-food-classification-and-the-trouble-with-ultraprocessing/2A9776922A28F8F757BDA32C3266AC2A">pdf</a>, <a href="https://archive.wphna.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WN-2016-7-1-3-28-38-Monteiro-Cannon-Levy-et-al-NOVA.pdf">pdf</a>),
Carlos Augusto Monteiro, Geoffrey Cannon, Jean-Claude Moubarac, Renata Bertazzi Levy, Maria Laura C. Louzada and Patrícia Constante Jaime advocate for the adoption of a system of grades from 1 to 4 to allow to simply compare the degree of processing of products.</p>
  
<p>New research associating researchers from Inserm, Inra and the Paris 13 University (Centre de recherche épidémiologie et statistique Sorbonne Paris Cité, équipe EREN) suggest a correlation between the cosumption of ultra-transformed foods and an increased risk of developing a cancer. </p>

<p>Some countries use the NOVA groups for their dietary guidelines or goals, for instance:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.fao.org/nutrition/education/food-based-dietary-guidelines/regions/countries/brazil/en/">Brazil's dietary guidelines</a> recommend to limit consumption of processed food and avoid ultra-processed food.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.hcsp.fr/Explore.cgi/avisrapportsdomaine?clefr=648">France's public health nutritional policy goals for 2018-2022</a> aims to reduce consumption of group 4 ultra-processed foods by 20%.</li>
</ul>

The NOVA classification assigns a group to food products based on how much processing they have been through:

<ul>
<li>Group 1 - Unprocessed or minimally processed foods</li>
<li>Group 2 - Processed culinary ingredients</li>
<li>Group 3 - Processed foods</li>
<li>Group 4 - Ultra-processed food and drink products</li>

<h2>The Nova score on Open Food Facts</h2>

<p>The formula for calculating the Nova score were published in the <a href="https://archive.wphna.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WN-2016-7-1-3-28-38-Monteiro-Cannon-Levy-et-al-NOVA.pdf">NOVA. The star shines bright</a> article
published in World Nutrition Volume  7, Number 1 - 3, January - March 2016 </p>

<p>Please note that this is still experimental work as multilingual taxonomisation of ingredients is still an ongoing work on Open Food Facts.</p>

<h2>Formula to determine the Nova group</h2>
  
<h3>We start by assigning group 1</h3>

<h4>We first try to identify group 2 processed culinary ingredients</h4>

[[processing/group-2-ingredients.html]]
  
<h4>Ingredients and categories associated with group 3 will not be applied to food identified as group 2</h4>

[[processing/group-3-ingredients.html]]

<h4>Ingredients and categories only found in group 4</h4>

[[processing/group-4-ingredients.html]]


<p>You can help us determine the Nova group for more products by completing the ingredients and the categories of products.</p>
