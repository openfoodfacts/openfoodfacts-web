<h2>Our challenge: assess the environmental impacts of all food products in Europe</h2>

<p>Open Food Facts&rsquo;s mission is to <strong>empower people to make better food choices for themselves and for the planet, by creating full transparency of the food system</strong>.</p>
<p>Unlike nutrition, <strong>it&rsquo;s hard to assess the exact impact of all your personal food choices on the planet</strong> and change your behaviour accordingly.</p>
<p>To counter this problem, <strong>we will compute environmental footprints for millions of food products across Europe, and link them to barcode scanning so that consumers and producers can take specific actions to reduce their impact.</strong></p>

<p>We hope it will support a greener, more sustainable economic recovery by <strong>empowering producers to eco-create or eco-improve the products they sell</strong>, and consumers to reorient their food choices for the planet.</p>
<p><strong>We also hope that</strong> - if we&rsquo;re successful - that <strong>in five years, a majority of food products sold in Europe will have an environmental impact front-of-pack label</strong> recognized by hundreds of millions of consumers, <strong>and producers will be actively reducing their impact.</strong></p>

			<h2>What is the Google.org Impact Challenge?</h2>
			<br />
			<img alt="" style="max-height: 50px" src="https://static.openfoodfacts.org/images/misc/google-dot-org-logo.png" title="">
			<p>Per Google.org&rsquo;s words, <i>&ldquo;This program is designed to help scale existing initiatives to meet the demanding challenges of addressing climate change. It commits &euro;10M to fund bold ideas that aim to use technology to accelerate Europe&rsquo;s progress toward a greener, more resilient future.&rdquo;</i></p>
			<p>In other words (our own), this is a large grant (1,1 million euros) to work on the ambitious project we proposed to the Google Impact Challenge contest and accelerate the work we&rsquo;ve been doing on the environment.</p>

		<h2>We have already started with the Eco-Score... but it's only the start!</h2>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="small-12 large-7 xlarge-8 columns">

		<p><b><a href="/ecoscore">Less than 2 months after the launch of the Eco-Score in France,</a> we have already seen consumers and producers engage with the Eco-Score and start changing their behaviours. That&rsquo;s great !</b></p>
		<p>Environmental assessments have to be adapted to each country, and to each product. For instance, depending on the transportation methods, the breeding and cultivation methods, or the origins of the ingredients, the environmental impact will vary.</p>
		<p>The data we are using is also very French. We have a lot of information on the famous French cheese diversity, but very little on European specialties like the Belgian waffle or the Polish Bigos.
		Expanding to all European countries will require substantially more resources than the initial launch of the Eco-Score, which leveraged the incredible work by ADEME.</p>
		<p><b>We want to offer producers very precise computations to help them change their products for the better and thus increase our impact beyond consumer behaviour change to systemic change.</b></p>
		<p>This massive change of scale is exactly what the Google Impact Challenge is about. Food related emissions represent a large part of global carbon emissions, and we feel the environmental work we&rsquo;re doing could be part of the solution.</p>

<p>In parallel, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adapt our producer platform and apps to help gather even more data about the environmental characteristics of products.</li>
<li>Gather additional environmental assessments to support global expansion</li>
<li><strong>Support the rapid growth of the Eco-Score both on the digital and physical world</strong> through our apps, ecosystem and new and existing partnerships (producers, governments, researchers, apps&hellip;)</li>

<h2>What it will change, and what it will not change</h2>
<p>Please rest assured that this grant won't change anything about <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/open-food-facts-vision-mission-values-and-programs">the Open Food Facts projects and goals</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We will of course continue to release everything that we do for free as open source and open data</strong> (The power of open source and open data was actually noted as a strong point for maximizing impact in our application).</p>
<p><strong>Google.org is financially helping us (and other winners) accelerate a complex technological project</strong> to expand our environmental impact to all Europe. <strong>The condition is we actually execute the project we proposed, and help make a large impact on the carbon challenges we all face.</strong></p>
