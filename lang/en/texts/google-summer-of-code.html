<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>Open Food Facts is a non-profit open source and open data project with a massive impact on the food and health of millions of people across the world, and we need your help to make this impact even bigger in many more parts of the world!</p>
<p>Open Food Facts is <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/organizations/open-food-facts">a participating organization</a> for the&nbsp;<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code 2022</a>.</p>
    
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>If you would like to work on Open Food Facts projects during the Google Summer of Code, make sure to&nbsp;<a href="https://slack.openfoodfacts.org/">join the Open Food Facts community on Slack</a>, introduce yourself there and get familiar with the project.</p>
<p>A good way to do that is to open your fridge or cupboard to find a food item to scan with our Android or iOS application. Open Food Facts works like Wikipedia. The food product may already be in the database with its data completed. If it&rsquo;s present, you will get valuable information about its nutritional quality (Nutri-Score) or its level of food processing (NOVA). If it&rsquo;s not present yet, please take some pictures and add it!</p>

    <h3>What we're looking for</h3>
<p>Please note that there are likely to be more students applying than we will have places allocated by Google, so make sure you make your application is a good one. We are looking for:</p>
<ul>  
    <li>Enthusiasm for your proposed project</li>
    <li>Experience with the tools you will need to complete the project (eg. demonstrated ability in the relevant programming language or environment)</li>
    <li>Information on how you would approach the project, what time you can put into it and what you think you will be able to achieve over the GSoC period</li>
    </ul>

    
<h3>Make a Small Contribution</h3>
<p>We want to make sure that new contributors are familiar with our development workflow and with the tools involved with it. Make at least one small code contribution to an Open Food Facts project (preferribly related to the project you want to work on during GSoC) to demonstrate you can build the application from the source code, make changes to it, and submit a merge request in the project's GitHub repository.</p>
    
<h3>Decide on a GSoC project</h3>
<p>Our mentors put together a list of project ideas that you can choose. Project proposals are not strictly limited to the ones listed in this project ideas page. You can contact the main developers or any Open Food Facts project on a public channel, introduce yourself, and suggest your own project ideas. Base any ideas you propose on a small research about the needs of a projects and/or users and make sure there is interest from a mentor before basing your application on it.</p>

    <!--<p>To learn how to contribute code to Open Food Facts, go through our <a href="">Newcomers tutorial</a>.</p>-->
    
    
<h3>Fill out the Application</h3>

<p>Once the application period has opened, you have to submit your application on the Google Summer of Code website. Your application must be written in English. It should contain a detailed description of your project proposal.</p>

<p>Copy our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xb6aOlPxlnvsGLoyROyGk-qnOjFozQ7jqupfbV8H2u0/edit?usp=sharing">Google Document template</a> and make sure you answer all of the questions.</p>

<p>Please be factual and clear in answering these questions. Feel free to add anything else that is relevant for your application. It is never too early to start working on your GSoC application! Note that GSoC positions are very competitive (with about 4 applicants for one position in the past) The key to creating a strong proposal is to propose a manageable and agreed-upon project, make a contribution to the module your proposal is related to, and write an application that clearly demonstrates your knowledge, skills, and enthusiasm.</p>
    
<h3>Getting started now tasklist</h3>
    <p>The following things can help you select a project and prepare your idea:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://slack.openfoodfacts.org/">Join our chat room</a></li>
    <li>Introduce yourself in the #summerofcode channel</li>
    <li>Join the channels related to the language/project/countries you're interested in</li>
    <li>It is important to first familiarize with the software. Try to make it run on your device/machine.</li>
    <li>Once you're able to run it, try one of our "good first issues" on GitHub</li>
    <li>Please, go through the available tutorials and direct your questions to the Slack chat, in the most specific channel possible.</li>
    <li>As you learn, it is also a good idea to propose updates to the documentation.</li>
    <li>If you have not worked before with Git Branching, we encourage you to visit this web: <a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/">https://learngitbranching.js.org/</a></li>
    <li>Look at the <a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts">list of all the Open Food Facts projects</a></li>
    <li>Read the project's README on the repository, feel free to ask for necessary clarifications</li>
    <li>Lurk on the project's chat channel</li>
    <li>Look at the recent changes in the project's GitHub repository</li>
    <li><a href="https://forms.gle/DzcwqUD79u7os9Lv6"><b>Fill our introduction survey</b></a> (it is NOT an application form)</li>
</ul>
    
    
<h2>Areas where your help can make a big difference</h2>
<p>Open Food Facts does many things like food products data acquisition and analysis on the backend, data visualization on the Open Food Facts website and mobile apps. This page presents the major systems and the technology we use, and the current challenges you could help us address during GSOC.</p>
<p>You can get&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts">a full overview of our repositories on GitHub</a>, along with hierarchized lists of impactful things you can work on. Here&apos;s our proposed selection of ideas:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    Note: The projects are migrated to the Wiki, with additional information being added on a rolling basis. You can also ask and discuss projects there.
