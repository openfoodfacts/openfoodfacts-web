              The planet canâ€™t wait any longer! Worldwide, food accounts for 28%
              of greenhouse gas emissions, 70% of drinking water consumption and
              the majority of packaging waste. We calculate and display the
              Eco-Score for hundreds of thousands of products (even when it is
              not yet displayed on the packaging).
