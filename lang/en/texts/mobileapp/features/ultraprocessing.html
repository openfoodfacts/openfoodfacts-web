              You have probably heard of ultra-processed foods. They are bad for
              your health, and it’s sometimes tricky to spot them, due to clever
              marketing. We help you spot ultra-processed foods by analyzing the
              ingredient list (hint: if you don’t recognize the name of the
              ingredients, there’s a fair chance it’s ultra-processed)
