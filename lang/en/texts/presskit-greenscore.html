    <h2>Green-Score: Environmental Impact Information for All Products</h2>
    <h4 class="subheader">Our goal, mirroring the success of Nutri-Score, is not just mobile scanning, but transforming the food industry by making environmental impact information transparent and directly accessible on shelves and online.</h4>
    <p class="text-left">The Green-Score (formerly Eco-Score) is an experimental A+ to F rating indicating the environmental impact of food products. Based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) data covering factors like greenhouse gas emissions, resource depletion, and pollution, it empowers consumers to make more sustainable choices and encourages producers to adopt greener practices.</p>
