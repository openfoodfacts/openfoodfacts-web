<p>The Eco-Score appears on the label of food products only in some countries and for a currently limited number of brands, but it is computed for all products of all countries on Open Food Facts since 2014!</p>

<p>You can see the Eco-Score of food products with the Open Food Facts iPhone and Android mobile app, and on the Open Food Facts web site. If the product is not yet on Open Food Facts, you can add it in a minute by selecting a category, adding packaging, origins of ingredients, organic and other environmental labels, and the Eco-Score will be computed and shown instantly.</p>
