<p>One rainy afternoon, here we are locked up at home with Chiara and Liam, but luck for us, I have a small batch of packaging that I collected during the previous week, and if we s had fun adding them to Open Food Facts!?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.openfoodfacts.org/">Open Food Facts</a> is the open database of foods from around the world. One of the objectives is to be able to measure the environmental impact of our food choices and for this purpose a <a href="https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/fr/news/loperation-plein-pot-sur-les- Emballage -ademe-x-open-food-facts">special operation on packaging</a> is in progress!</p>

<h2>We're getting ready</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> For this purpose, for a week I have been collecting packaging. I took a small bag and gradually I put my packaging in it. For this, it is necessary to recover a piece of each element of which the packaging is made. For example, for yogurts, I keep the cardboard packaging, a jar and its lid. For a packet of biscuits, don't forget the small internal sachets. To clean, a little bit of absorbent paper is often more effective than water and avoids having to drain... and cleaning before storing avoids bad smells!</p>

<p>I also bought a precision scale. I paid mine a little less than 20‚Ç¨ in a store near my home (but you can also find it for less than 10‚Ç¨!). It goes from 0 to 200g with an accuracy of 0.01g. We will see that this 200g limit is a bit prohibitive for some packaging and another scale would be needed for heavier packaging.</p>

<p>We find a stable place for the balance, in fact it is very sensitive to variations in orientation.</p>

<p>The idea is first to write down on a sheet of paper. Not having a printer, the painting will be done by hand. The columns you need: the barcode, the number, the shape of the packaging, the material, the capacity, the weight of the packaging.</p>

<p>So we spread our waste on a large table, grouped by product, ready to start:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:media-text -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The workshop begins</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now we start taking the packaging one by one. We note the barcode of the product, then for each element, we check how many there are for each product, we describe the shape, the material, the capacity and we weigh.</p>

<p>The weighing is the most delicate moment, at the beginning it was Liam who had to take care of it, but the operation turns out to be more complicated than expected! The scale is small and the wrappers are large and twisted.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first idea is to use a rubber band that we have weighed, and from which we will deduct the weight, to keep the packaging in a compact shape, but that works badly: depending on how we position the element , the mass changes a little!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally <strong>the technique that will work best is to use a plastic jar (a package) that can easily contain the other packages (possibly folded).</strong> In addition, the scale allows you to put the tare at 0 with the pot on it, there is no more calculation to do!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then, we start to chain the packaging. I take a packaging, I give its shape, material, etc. and Chiara notes. Sometimes she picks me up, because caught in the heat of the moment I forget things, there are not too many of us. Liam weighs with me, but it's not so easy to read a measurement at his age, the notion of decimal places is, for example, not integrated!</p>

<p>A difficult thing is to find out what plastic a packaging is made of. Sometimes the indication is printed (often on the plastic films), and easy to find, but when it is in relief, in small it is difficult. Sometimes you have to grope to the touch... Even having found it, it is sometimes difficult to read what it is for lack of contrast! </p>

<p>For difficult cases, we put a piece of paper on top, then we colored the sheet with a pencil to show the logo and the inscription (<a href="https://drive .google.com/file/d/1L0ZRqVz7F1cv1qOSkYMXbml5VzNiu3h1/view?usp=sharing" data-type="URL" data-id="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L0ZRqVz7F1cv1qOSkYMXbml5VzNiu3h1/view?usp=sharing ">see video</a>).</p>

<p>Besides, for the corks, I weigh the cork with its ring, because it is the size of the material that interests us!</p>

<p>For the lids on the other hand, we can at least know if they are made of steel or in another material (probably aluminum) thanks to a magnet. We used a fridge magnet for this.</p>

<p>For each product, we go to the site <a href="https://fr.openfoodfacts.org">https://fr.openfoodfacts.org</a>. In the search bar, you enter the barcode, which allows you to get directly to the product. We then click on ‚Äúmodify the file‚Äù at the top right, and we go to the ‚Äúpackaging‚Äù area. I delete the text from the I fill in the ‚ÄúElements<em>packaging</em>‚Äù area using our list. And I did not forget to check the box indicating that all elements have been entered.</ p>

<p>A small difficulty arises in the seizure of plastics. Not easy to make the link between the logos and the name of the material (for example HDPE is also HDPE). Some pages found on the internet in cross-referencing with <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_d%27identification_des_r%C3%A9sines">the wikipedia page</a>, help us.</ p>

<p>There you go, mission accomplished for the little team! It is a small stone laid to help map the use of packaging, in order to better understand our consumption choices and the differences between products. By manipulating the packaging we also better understood how it is made, what is recyclable or not.</p>
