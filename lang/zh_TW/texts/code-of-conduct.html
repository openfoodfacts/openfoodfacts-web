<h1 class="emphasized-title">行為準則</h1>

<p>Open Food Facts is a project driven by a community of volunteers. 所有事項均是參與者的保證，所有事項均以舒適的節奏進行，所有事項均與外邦人和科爾特西亞人之間的聲音有關：</p>

<h2 class="emphasized-title">Rules</h2>

<h3>No discrimination</h3>

<p>Open Food Facts is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone regardless of age, gender,  sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion.</p>

<h3>No harassment and no threats</h3>

<p>We will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form, or anything that threatens personal safety.</p>

<h3>不得對個人貢獻者提出不尊重的要求</h3>

<p>All Open Food Facts participants and contributors are unpaid volunteers who dedicate time and energy to the project. Please take this into account when you request something from an individual contributor,
and do accept answers like "No," "Not now," "Maybe," and/or "I don't know". Repeated and/or undue pressure to make a contributor do/answer something will be considered as harassment.</p>

<p>Requests that are likely to generate a significant amount of work should be sent to the administrators at contact@openfoodfacts.org and not to individual contributors.</p>


<h2>Consequences of not respecting the code of conduct</h2>

<p>People violating these rules may be temporary blocked or permanently banned from the project at the discretion of the administrators of the Open Food Facts Association.</p>

<p>In particular, bad actors who repeatedly ignore the rules and culture of the project, who are needlessly argumentative or hostile, or who are offensive, and who are unable to self-correct their behavior when asked to do so by others will be permanently banned from the project.</p>



<h2 class="emphasized-title">Reporting abuse</h2>

<p>您可以透過電子郵件方式與我們聯繫，以獲取有關濫用行為或濫用行為的資訊。 
Please include as much detail as possible. It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.</p>

<p>Your report will be read, treated and answered by Stéphane Gigandet (President of the Open Food Facts Association) and Florentin Raud (initiator of this Code of conduct).</p>

<br/><br>

<p>Note: this code of conduct is inspired by the codes of conduct of other open communities like the <a href="https://contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a>. Feel free to reuse it or part of it.</p>
