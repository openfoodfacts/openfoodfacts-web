        <h2>Expert help needed</h2>
        <p>Developing Open Pet Food Facts also requires specialized knowledge and expertise in many different areas:</p>
    </div>
</div>

<ul class="text-center small-block-grid-1 medium-block-grid-2 large-block-grid-3">
    <li>
        <h3>Project management</h3>
        <p>We have tons of ideas and you probably have even more, but it is quite a challenge to prioritize them,
to build a roadmap, and to manage projects when every participant is a volunteer with often limited time available.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>We need help to build a better user experience on the Open Pet Food Facts web site and mobile app, to improve
their design, to create impactful presentation materials etc.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>We have a lot of development work to do: on the Open Pet Food Facts backend (Perl and MongoDB), API (JSON),
        web site (HTML5, JS, Foundation), and the mobile app. Our code is on <a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts">GitHub</a>.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <h3>Community building</h3>
        <p>We need to build local communities in all countries and at the same time unite them globally.</p>
        <p>It is very difficult to bootstrap a local community in a country without living there, so your help
        to find the first very motivated participants is essential. Are you one of them?</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>We are not sure what to write here, could you help?</p>
        <p>More seriously, there are lot of cool things that users, contributors and reusers do with Open Pet Food Facts,
        it would be great to get more people to know about it. In particular, we need help for public
        and <a href="/press">media relations</a>.</p>
        
    </li>   
    
    <li>
        <h3>Special projects</h3>
        <p>There are lots of interesting and original applications of pet food open data that we could work on with
        veterinarians, pet nutritionists, pet food manufacturers, researchers, universities, schools, animal welfare NGOs etc. Maybe you already have ideas?
        If you do, please help us to push them forward.</p>
