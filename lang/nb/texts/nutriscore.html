  <p>The Nutri-Score is a logo that shows the nutritional quality of food products with A to E grades. With the NutriScore, products can be easily and quickly compared.</p>
    
Open Food Facts has started computing Nutri-Score in 2014 on its pioneer mobile app and website, while it was only a research paper, and has accompanied its growth from the "5 color score" to the "Nutri-Score" you see in supermarkets today.
This systemic impact was noticed by Santé publique France which is now supporting Open Food Facts in its mission to help everyone make more informed food choices.

<h2>How is Nutri-Score computed?</h2>

  <p>The Nutri-Score grade is determined by the amount of healthy and unhealthy nutrients:</p>

  <p><b>Negative points:</b> energy, saturated fat, sugars, sodium (high levels are considered unhealthy)</p>
  <p><b>Positive points:</b> the proportion of fruits, vegetables and nuts, of olive, colza and nut oils, of fibers and proteins (high levels are considered good for health).</p>

<h2>How can I see the Nutri-Score of food products?</h2>

<div class="row">

  <div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">


<p>The Nutri-Score appears on the label of food products only in some countries and for a currently limited number of brands, but it is computed for all products of all countries on Open Food Facts since 2014!</p>

<p>You can see the Nutri-Score of food products with the Open Food Facts iPhone and Android mobile app, and on the Open Food Facts web site. If the product is not yet on Open Food Facts, you can add it in a minute by adding the nutrition facts and selecting a category, and the Nutri-Score will be computed and shown instantly.</p>

<h2>Who created the Nutri-Score?</h2>

<p>Nutri-Score has been proposed by EREN, a French public nutrition research team, led by Professor Serge Hercberg. It is based on the FSA nutritional score created by the Food Standards Agency in the UK.</p>

  <p>The Nutri-Score is presented in the 2013 report "Proposals for a new impetus to the French public health nutrition policy in the framework of the National Health Strategy" (<a href="https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/rapport_Hercberg_15_11_2013.pdf">pdf</a>).
Professor Serge Hercberg advocates for the adoption of a system of grades from A to E on the front of food products to allow to easily compare the nutritional quality of products.</p>


<h2>Which countries have adopted the Nutri-Score ?</h2>


<p>The Nutri-Score has been adopted in France in 2016, and in Belgium and Spain in 2018. Some producers in Germany are also using the Nutri-Score. The Nutri-Score is optional in these countries, but a growing number of food manufacturers are displaying it on their products:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><a href="https://be.openfoodfacts.org/label/nutriscore/brands">Brands with Nutri-Score in Belgium</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://es.openfoodfacts.org/label/nutriscore/brands">Brands with Nutri-Score in Spain</a></li>
  </ul>

<p>Research teams in other countries, like Mexico, are also conducting research based on Nutri-Score.</p>

<h2>The #PRONUTRISCORE Petition: Consumers across the EU are joining forces for 1 million signatures</h2>

  <p>UFC-Que Choisir (France), Test-Achat (Belgium), VZBV (Germany), Consumentenbond (The Netherlands), OCU (Spain), Federajca Konsumentow (Poland) and EKPIZO (Greece), members of the European Bureau of Consumer Associations (BEUC) have teamed up to ask the EU commission to make the Nutri-Score compulsory on food packagings.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>We are asking the European Commission to impose simplified ‘Nutriscore’ labelling on food products, to guarantee that consumers are provided with quality nutritional information and to protect their health.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Make nutritional labelling easier to read and understand, so that the nutritional value of a food can be understood at a glance in the face of the diversity of food supply;</li>
<li>Take action on public health issues by encouraging professionals to improve the composition of their products;</li>
 <li>Harmonise nutritional information at European level by imposing a single official labelling system, thereby putting an end to the confusion experienced by European consumers when faced by the plethora of existing logos.</li>
  </ol>
  </blockquote>
