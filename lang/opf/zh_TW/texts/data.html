<h2 class="emphasized-title">Open Products Facts data exports</h2>

<p>Database dumps and exports are generated nightly. The database is very big, so you can find <a href="https://wiki.openfoodfacts.org/Reusing_Open_Food_Facts_Data">different ways to use the data</a>, depending on the export flavor.</p>

<p>Information on the different fields for the MongoDB dump and CSV exports is available at <a href="https://static.openproductsfacts.org/data/data-fields.txt">https://world-opf.openproductsfacts.org/data/data-fields.txt</a></p>

<h3>MongoDB dump</h3>

<p>Data for all products is available in a MongoDB database dump.</p>
<!--
<h4>Why you'd want to use it: </h4>
<ul>
 <li>This is more comprehensive than CSV exports, if you are looking to advanced use cases.</li>

<h4>Delta Export</h4>

<p>Daily delta exports are provided for the previous 14 days. The list of currently available delta files can be found at <a href="https://static.openproductsfacts.org/data/delta/index.txt">https://static.openproductsfacts.org/data/delta/index.txt</a>.</p>
<p>Each line represents a file that is available at <code>https://static.openproductsfacts.org/data/delta/{filename}</code>.</p>
<p>The filename contains UNIX timestamp of the first and the last change contained in the JSON file, so that the delta files can be imported (after extraction) with <code>mongoimport</code> in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Please note that due to the nature of <code>mongoexport</code>, the delta files cannot tell you about deleted products. To remove deleted products from your database, you will need to import the full MongoDB dump.</p>

<h3>JSONL data export</h3>

<p>The whole database is also available in <a href="https://jsonlines.org/">JSONL format</a> (sometimes called LDJSON or NDJSON) where each line is a JSON object. It represents the same data as the MongoDB export. The file is compressed with gzip.</p>

<p>A suitable way to exploit the database is to use DuckDB, an in-process analytical tool designed to process large amount of data in a fraction of seconds.

<h3>CSV Data Export</h3>
<p>Data for all products, or some of the products, can be downloaded in CSV format (readable with OpenOffice, Excel and many other software)

<h2 class="emphasized-title">Live JSON and XML API</h2>

<p>A JSON API is also available to read the data for a product. This API is in particular used in the Open Products Facts mobile app for iPhone and Android.</p>

<p>We improve the API over-time but we are careful to keep backwards compatibility. Please <a href="mailto:reuse@openfoodfacts.org?subject=Open%20Products%20Facts%20Data%20reuse">get in touch</a> if you use it, so that we can tell you about potential changes.</p>

<p>URL to read data for a product: https://world-opf.openproductsfacts.org/api/v2/product/<i>[barcode]</i>.json</p>

<p>Example: <a href="https://world-opf.openproductsfacts.org/api/v2/product/8710847992063.json">https://world-opf.openproductsfacts.org/api/v2/product/8710847992063.json</a></p>
<p>Note that if the output is too overwhelming, you can filter it - as described in the API documentation.</p>

<h3 class="emphasized-title">OpenAPI help wanted</h3>
We're eager to finish the documentation of the API, add use-cases, and automate SDK generation. If you are an OpenAPI connoisseur, you are very welcome to help.

 </li>
-->

<p>You are very welcome to use the API for production cases, as long as 1 API call = 1 real scan by a user.
Any attempt to scrape the database using the API will very likely be blocked, as full daily exports are available on this very page.</p>
<p>Also, sending an HTTP header with your API call is a good way we can get in touch, should any issue arise.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about anything, or have any question (there is no silly question), feel free to ask it on the #api channel on Slack :-)</p>

<h3 class="emphasized-title">Experimental XML API</h3>
<p>You can also get the result in XML by using <code>.xml</code></p>

This API is not actively maintained, and not officially documented.


<h2 class="emphasized-title">Wrappers and SDKs</h2>
<p>We probably have a wrapper for your favorite programming language. If we do, you can use it and improve it. If we don't, you can help create it.</p>
<p>They will let you consume data, as well as let your users contribute new data</p>

<h3>General principles to make your users happy</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can search for information about products, including many useful computed values.</li>
<li>If you can't get the information on a specific product, you can get your user to send photos and data, that will then be processed by Open Products Facts AI and contributors to get the computed result you want to show them.</li>
<li>You can also implement the complete flow so that they get immediately the result with some effort on their side.</li>
</ul>

<h3>If your users do not expect a result immediately (e.g. Inventory apps)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Submit photos (front/nutrition/ingredients): most painless thing for your users</li>
<li>The Open Products Facts AI - Robotoff - will generate some derived data from the photos</li>
<li>Over time, other apps, and the Open Products Facts community will fill the data gaps</li>
</ul>

<h3>If your users expect a result immediately (e.g. Nutrition or Allergy apps)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Submit ingredients + category &gt; get Ingredient analysis, additives, allergens, normalized ingredients, vegan, vegetarian&hellip;</li>
<li>Submit labels for added value</li>
<li>Submit nutrition</li>
</ul>

<h3>Android and iPhone mobile app</h3>
