<p>We will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form, or anything that threatens personal safety.</p>

<h3>Pa gen okenn demand ki manke respè pou kontribitè endividyèl yo.</h3>

<p>All Open Food Facts participants and contributors are unpaid volunteers who dedicate time and energy to the project. Please take this into account when you request something from an individual contributor,
and do accept answers like "No," "Not now," "Maybe," and/or "I don't know". Repeated and/or undue pressure to make a contributor do/answer something will be considered as harassment.</p>

<p>People violating these rules may be temporary blocked or permanently banned from the project at the discretion of the administrators of the Open Food Facts Association.</p>

<p>In particular, bad actors who repeatedly ignore the rules and culture of the project, who are needlessly argumentative or hostile, or who are offensive, and who are unable to self-correct their behavior when asked to do so by others will be permanently banned from the project.</p>
