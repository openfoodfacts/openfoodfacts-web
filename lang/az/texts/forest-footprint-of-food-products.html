<h1>Forest footprint of food products</h1>
<p>In collaboration with the <a href="https://envol-vert.org/en/">Envol Vert</a> NGO, Open Food Facts calculates its forest footprint for each product, which corresponds to the associated risk of deforestation to its ingredients.</p>
<p>Deforestation in South America and particularly in Brazil is linked to the cultivation of soybeans, which are massively imported to feed the poultry that we eat or whose eggs we eat.</p>
<p>The calculation of the forest footprint is based on the quantity of chicken and egg contained in each product. The different categories and labels (organic, Label Rouge, Bleu Blanc Coeur, GMO food or not, etc.) make it possible to estimate the quantity of soy necessary for the production of each ingredient, the yield of its cultivation, and the risk of deforestation.</p>
