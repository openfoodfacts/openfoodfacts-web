<h1>3. Personal data processed by OpenFoodFacts</h1>
<h2>Non-sensitive personal data</h2>
<p>From you, Open Food Facts only collects data strictly necessary for the operation of its various services.</p>
<p>Regarding the user name (which may be a pseudonym) and email address, contributors are required to provide them to register and/or connect to their accounts via the mobile applications and the website. Therefore, refusing to provide this data will only allow you to use Open Food Facts services as a visitor.</p>
<p>Your personal data processed for one of the Open Food Facts services is automatically transferred for the use of other services (mobile applications, Open Food Facts websites, Wiki, Forum, Hunger Games, etc.). You can object to this by deleting your account knowing that this deletion only allows you to access Open Food Facts services as a visitor.</p>
<h2>Sensitive personal data</h2>
<p>Based on your consent and in order to help you sort and identify products corresponding to your dietary preferences, the following user preferences, which may relate to your health, are collected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nutritional quality (amount of salt, sugar, fat, fatty acid);</li>

<h1>4. Public and private information:</h1>
<p>The&nbsp;username and user ID can be visible to other users of our services unlike email which is confidential. The country in which the contributor added and/or modified a product is also visible and can be cross-referenced with their username.</p>
<p>The database is published in its entirety under an open data license, which is one of the primary goals of the project. It only contains the user's identifier as well as the products he added and modified, products possibly located in a country.</p>
<p>When deleting the user account, the user ID is replaced with a random but unique username for that user. All other personal data is deleted.</p>
<h1>5. Cookies and other terminal identifiers</h1>
<p>Cookies are small files that a site or its service providers transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser.</p>
