		<h2>Science-based, and helping Science</h2>
		<h4 class="subheader"></h4>
		<p class="text-left">Science is one of the core pillars of Open Food Facts. Open Food Facts, from its creation in 2012, has relied on peer-reviewed scientific work to inform the public, like Nutri-Score and NOVA, and by making them available for a massive amount of people, across the world. We are also very happy and proud to see scientists reuse our data to push scientific knowledge forward. We love to engage with research teams to see what they can come up with, and how we can help them.</p>
		<p>If you're using or considering using Open Food Facts as part of a science project, please let us know at <a href="mailto:contact@openfoodfacts.org">contact@openfoodfacts.org</a>
