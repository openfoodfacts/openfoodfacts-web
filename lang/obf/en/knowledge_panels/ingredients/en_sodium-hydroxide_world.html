<li><strong><em>What it is:</em></strong> Caustic soda or lye, a highly alkaline inorganic compound. Used in very small amounts in cosmetics.</li>
<li><strong><em>Why it's used:</em></strong> Adjusts and maintains pH levels in formulations. Neutralizes acids to achieve optimal pH for skin compatibility.</li>
<li><strong><em>Concerns:</em></strong></li>
<li>In pure form, it's highly caustic and dangerous.</li>
<li>In finished cosmetic products at proper concentrations, it's neutralized and safe.</li>
<li>Used at very low levels to adjust pH, not as an active ingredient.</li>
