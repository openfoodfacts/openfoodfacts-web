<li><strong><em>What it is:</em></strong> A clear, colorless liquid derived from plant oils or synthesized from propylene. It's one of the most common ingredients in cosmetics.</li>
<li><strong><em>Why it's used:</em></strong> Acts as a humectant, drawing moisture from the air into the skin. Also serves as a solvent and improves product texture.</li>
<li><strong><em>Types:</em></strong> Plant-derived (from soybean, palm, or coconut oil) or synthetic (from propylene).</li>
<li><strong><em>Concerns:</em></strong></li>
<li>Generally recognized as safe for cosmetic use.</li>
<li>Highly hygroscopic, so in very dry environments it may draw moisture from skin rather than air.</li>
<li>Plant-sourced glycerin raises sustainability concerns if derived from palm oil.</li>
