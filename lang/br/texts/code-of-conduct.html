<h3>No discrimination</h3>

<p>Open Food Facts is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone regardless of age, gender,  sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion.</p>

<h3>No harassment and no threats</h3>

<p>We will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form, or anything that threatens personal safety.</p>

<h3>Goulennoù dismegañsus ebet ouzh ar genlabourerien hiniennel</h3>

<p>All Open Food Facts participants and contributors are unpaid volunteers who dedicate time and energy to the project. Please take this into account when you request something from an individual contributor,
and do accept answers like "No," "Not now," "Maybe," and/or "I don't know". Repeated and/or undue pressure to make a contributor do/answer something will be considered as harassment.</p>

<p>Requests that are likely to generate a significant amount of work should be sent to the administrators at contact@openfoodfacts.org and not to individual contributors.</p>


<h2>Consequences of not respecting the code of conduct</h2>

<p>People violating these rules may be temporary blocked or permanently banned from the project at the discretion of the administrators of the Open Food Facts Association.</p>

<p>In particular, bad actors who repeatedly ignore the rules and culture of the project, who are needlessly argumentative or hostile, or who are offensive, and who are unable to self-correct their behavior when asked to do so by others will be permanently banned from the project.</p>
