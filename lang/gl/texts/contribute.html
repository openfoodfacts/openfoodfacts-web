Open Food Facts exists thanks to the citizens who give their time and talent in many different activities.

		<h2 class="emphasized-title">Precisamos axuda de expertas</h2>
		<p>Developing Open Beauty Facts also requires specialized knowledge and expertise in many different areas:</p>
	</div>
</div>

<ul class="text-center small-block-grid-1 medium-block-grid-2 large-block-grid-3">
	<li>
		<h3>Xesti√≥n de proxectos</h3>
		<p>We have tons of ideas and you probably have even more, but it is quite a challenge to prioritize them, to build a roadmap, and to manage projects when every participant is a volunteer with often limited time available.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>Dese√±o</h3>
		<p>We need help to build a better user experience on the Open Food Facts web site and mobile app, to improve their design, to create impactful presentation materials etc.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>Desenvolvemento</h3>
		<p>We have a <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/development">lot of development work to do</a>. On the Open Food Facts backend (Perl and MongoDB), API (JSON), web site (templatized HTML5, JS, Foundation), our <a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts/smooth-app">Flutter mobile app for iOS and Android</a>, but also to build new cool reuses etc. We have SDK projects in many programming languages to ensure anyone can reuse and contribute to Open Food Facts, in any language. We also have a growing Artificial Intelligence effort to simplify contribution work. Our code is on <a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts">GitHub</a>.
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>Constru√≠ndo Comunidade</h3>
		<p>Precisamos constru√≠r comunidades locais en todos os pa√≠ses e ao mesmo tempo unilas todas globalmente.</p>
		<p>It is very difficult to bootstrap a local community in a country without living there, so your help to find the first very motivated participants is essential. √â vostede unha delas?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Comunicaci√≥n</h3>
		<p>Non sabemos moi ben que escribir aqu√≠, poder√≠a axudarnos?</p>
		<p>More seriously, there are lot of cool things that users, contributors and reusers do with Open Food Facts, it would be great to get more people to know about it. In particular, we need help for public and <a href="/press">media relations</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Proxectos especiais</h3>
<p>There are lots of interesting and original applications of food open data that we could work on with government food agencies, food producers, researchers, universities, schools, NGOs etc. Quiz√°is vostede ten algunha idea? Si √© asi, por favor ax√∫denos a sacalas adiante.</p></li>
