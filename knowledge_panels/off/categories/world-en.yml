    - ***What it is: Comté is a firm, pressed-cooked cheese made from unpasteurized cow's milk, originating from the Franche-Comté region in eastern France. It holds an Appellation d'Origine Protégée (AOP) status, meaning its production is strictly regulated regarding geography, cow breed (primarily Montbéliarde or French Simmental), feed (no silage), and cheesemaking methods. It's produced in large wheels.
    - ***Types/Characteristics: The primary variation in Comté comes from its aging period. It must be aged for a minimum of 4 months, but is often aged much longer (e.g., 6, 12, 18, 24+ months).
        - **Aging:** Longer aging develops stronger, more complex flavors (nutty, fruity, savory, roasted) and a firmer, potentially crystalline texture (tyrosine crystals). Younger Comté is milder, milkier, and more supple.
        - **Seasonal Variation:** Flavors can also vary depending on the season the milk was produced – summer milk (from cows grazing on diverse pastures) often yields more fruity and floral notes, while winter milk (from cows fed hay) might result in nuttier, earthier flavors.
        - **Fruitière Variation:** Each village dairy (*fruitière*) and aging cellar (*affineur*) imparts subtle unique characteristics to the final cheese.
    - ***Concerns/Points of Interest:
        - **Raw Milk:** The use of unpasteurized milk is essential for Comté's characteristic flavor profile but requires stringent hygiene controls during production. While the long aging process significantly reduces risks associated with raw milk, it's a factor sometimes considered by specific consumer groups.
        - **Strict AOP Regulations:** While guaranteeing quality and tradition, the AOP rules limit the production zone, cow breeds, feed, and methods, making it a protected but geographically restricted product. This ensures authenticity but also influences cost and scalability.
        - **Lactose Content:** Due to the long aging process, Comté naturally contains very low levels of lactose, making it often digestible for individuals with lactose intolerance.
        - **Tyrosine Crystals:** The small, crunchy crystals found in more aged Comté are sometimes mistaken for salt but are actually clusters of the amino acid tyrosine, a natural byproduct of protein breakdown during aging and considered a sign of a well-matured cheese.
        - **Sustainability:** The traditional model often involves cooperative dairies (*fruitières*) and specific rules about pasture grazing, which can be seen as positive sustainability aspects compared to more industrialized cheese production, though general dairy farming concerns still apply, especially since demand is growing, on a limited AOP area, putting unsustainable pressure on the ecosystem.
