    - ***What it is:*** A syrup made from cornstarch, often used to sweeten and thicken processed foods.
    - ***Types:*** Light (clear and mildly sweet) and dark (caramel-flavored and less sweet).
    - ***Concerns:***
        - High in fructose, especially in the form of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). 
        - Linked to potential health issues like weight gain, metabolic disorders, and liver problems.
        - May contribute to "empty calories" with little nutritional value. 
        - Corn is very water hungry, which raises concerns about hydric stress

    - ***What it is: Also known as water, it's the most common ingredient in cosmetics. It acts as a solvent, carrying other ingredients, and contributes to the product's texture.
    - ***Types: Purified water, deionized water, distilled water. The quality of water used is important to avoid introducing contaminants.
    - ***Concerns:
        - While generally safe, water can contribute to the growth of microorganisms in products if proper preservation methods aren't used.
        - The environmental impact of water usage in manufacturing, especially in water-stressed regions, is a growing concern.
