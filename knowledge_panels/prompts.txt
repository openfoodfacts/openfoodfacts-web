    - ***What it is:*** A syrup made from cornstarch, often used to sweeten and thicken processed foods.
    - ***Types:*** Light (clear and mildly sweet) and dark (caramel-flavored and less sweet).
    - ***Concerns:***
        - High in fructose, especially in the form of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). 
        - Linked to potential health issues like weight gain, metabolic disorders, and liver problems.
        - May contribute to "empty calories" with little nutritional value. 
        - Corn is very water hungry, which raises concerns about hydric stress

Can you adapt this to talk about suncreams: en:sun creams:

  content: |-
    - ***What it is: Also known as water, it's the most common ingredient in cosmetics. It acts as a solvent, carrying other ingredients, and contributes to the product's texture.
    - ***Types: Purified water, deionized water, distilled water. The quality of water used is important to avoid introducing contaminants.
    - ***Concerns:
        - While generally safe, water can contribute to the growth of microorganisms in products if proper preservation methods aren't used.
        - The environmental impact of water usage in manufacturing, especially in water-stressed regions, is a growing concern.

### Additives

Generate an additive card in English, suitable for a database like Open Food Facts, using the following format and information.  Be concise but informative.  Assume a general audience with a basic understanding of food science. If information is not provided for a field, leave it blank or state "Unknown" if appropriate (e.g., for DJA if no value is given).  Prioritize factual accuracy and avoid speculation.
Additive Code (and Common Name): [Provide the E number or other relevant code, and the most common name.  Example: E100 Curcumin]
Main Function: [Describe the primary purpose of the additive in food.  Be specific. Example: "Natural food coloring (yellow)" instead of just "Coloring".  Use terms like "Antioxidant", "Preservative", "Emulsifier", "Thickener", "Sweetener", "Acidity regulator", "Flavor enhancer", "Anti-caking agent", "Stabilizer", etc. and combine if necessary.]
Family: [If applicable, state the chemical family or broader category the additive belongs to. Examples: "Polyol", "Anthocyanin", "Benzoate", "Sulphite", "Phosphate", "Nitrite/Nitrate".  If unknown or not easily categorized, leave blank.]
Example Food Products: [List 3-5 common food categories where the additive is typically found. Be specific enough to be helpful, but avoid brand names.  Examples: "Processed meats", "Confectionery", "Soft drinks", "Baked goods", "Dairy desserts", "Sauces", "Dressings", "Infant formula", "Processed cheese".]
Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) (mg/kg body weight/day): [Provide the ADI value if established. Use "Not specified" if no ADI has been set. Use "No ADI necessary" if the additive is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) with no specific limit.  Use the precise wording used by the relevant regulatory body (e.g., EFSA, FDA) if possible.]
Suitable for Organic Foods: [State "Yes" or "No". If conditionally permitted, add a brief explanation in parentheses. Example: "Yes (only from organic sources)", "No", "Yes (with restrictions)"].
Potential Allergies: [State "Yes" or "No". If "Yes", briefly specify the source or type of allergen. Example: "Yes (soy)", "Yes (milk)", "No", "Possible (traces of nuts)". If the risk is very low or theoretical, use "Possible" instead of "Yes".]
Dietary Restrictions:
    *   Vegetarian: [Yes/No/Possible - Explain if "Possible"]
    *   Vegan: [Yes/No/Possible - Explain if "Possible"]
    *   Halal: [Yes/No/Possible - Explain if "Possible"]
    *   Kosher: [Yes/No/Possible - Explain if "Possible"]
Origin and Manufacturing: [Briefly describe the source of the additive and how it's typically produced.  Example: "Naturally derived from turmeric root.", "Synthetically produced.", "Extracted from seaweed.", "Produced by fermentation of [source]."]
Regulatory Status (EU): [Approved/Not Approved/Restricted - If restricted, briefly explain the restriction]
Regulatory Status (US): [Approved/Not Approved/Restricted - If restricted, briefly explain the restriction]
Comments: [Provide a concise summary of any relevant information, including potential health concerns (even if minor or debated), benefits, or important usage notes.  Focus on objective, evidence-based information. Avoid overly alarmist or dismissive language. Address common misconceptions if applicable. *This is where you'd put the type of information found in the "Notre commentaire" section of your example.*  Keep it to 2-3 sentences maximum.]

Now, let's provide an example using this prompt. Let's say we want to create a card for E150a, Plain Caramel:
Additive Code (and Common Name): E150a Plain Caramel
Main Function: Food coloring (brown)
Family: Caramel color
Example Food Products: Soft drinks, baked goods, sauces, confectionery, spirits
Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) (mg/kg body weight/day): 300 (Group ADI for all caramel colors E150a-d)
Suitable for Organic Foods: No (Generally, although some certified organic bodies may permit specific E150a produced under certain conditions)

Potential Allergies: No

Dietary Restrictions:
    *   Vegetarian: Yes
    *   Vegan: Yes
    *   Halal: Yes (Generally, but certification is recommended)
    *   Kosher: Yes (Generally, but certification is recommended)

Origin and Manufacturing: Produced by controlled heat treatment of carbohydrates (sugars), typically from corn, wheat, or beet sugar.  No ammonium or sulfite compounds are used in the production of E150a.

Regulatory Status (EU): Approved
Regulatory Status (US): Approved

Comments: Plain caramel (E150a) is the simplest form of caramel color. It is generally considered safe, although some concerns have been raised about other types of caramel coloring (E150c, E150d).  Consumption at typical levels is not expected to pose a health risk.
