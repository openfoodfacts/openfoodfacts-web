"en:glycerin":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is:** A simple polyol (sugar alcohol) used as a humectant and moisturizer in cosmetics; it attracts and holds water in the skin.
    - ***Types:** Usually used as a pure clear liquid derived from vegetable oils or synthetically produced; available as USP or pharma grade.
    - ***Concerns: 
    - Generally considered safe and non-irritating at cosmetic levels.
    - pure glycerin is hygroscopic, but normal use levels do not dry skin. Rarely, highly sensitive individuals may experience minor irritation.
"en:sodium_chloride":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is:** Common table salt, used as a thickener, binder, and cleansing agent in personal care products. It's a white crystalline solid that adjusts viscosity (e.g. in shampoos) and provides mild exfoliating/scrubbing action.
    - ***Types:** Usually food-grade or cosmetic-grade salt (fine or coarse); does not vary chemically between uses.
    - ***Concerns:** 
    - Considered non-irritating and generally safe at cosmetic concentrations
    - Very high concentrations can be drying (as pure salt can dehydrate skin), but typical use levels do not cause dryness
"en:citric_acid":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is: An alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) naturally found in citrus fruits, used as a pH adjuster, chelating agent, and mild chemical exfoliant. It stabilizes formulas and can help with product viscosity and color stabilization.
    - ***Types: Exists as anhydrous (crystalline powder) or monohydrate; formulations may use citric acid or its salts (e.g. sodium citrate) for buffering.
    - ***Concerns: Generally safe at low concentrations. Can cause irritation or redness on sensitive skin, especially at higher strengths, and may increase sun sensitivity.
    - Overly acidic formulas can sting or damage skin.
"en:tocopherol":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is: A form of vitamin E (a family of tocopherols), used as an antioxidant in cosmetics. It protects oils and skin from oxidative damage, and can act as a mild moisturizer.
    - ***Types: Commonly alpha-tocopherol (often labeled D-alpha-tocopherol if natural, or mixed tocopherols); also tocopheryl acetate (a stable ester form).
    - ***Concerns: Generally safe and non-irritating when pure; must be high purity to avoid impurities. Contaminants (like heavy metals or residues from processing) can be a concern.
    - Rarely may cause contact allergy in sensitive individuals.
"en:panthenol":
  content: |-

    - ***Types: Viscosity and molecular weight vary (often listed by viscosity value, e.g. 100 cSt). It may also appear as copolymers (dimethicone crosspolymers) or in combination with cyclomethicone. Typically colorless and odorless.
    - ***Concerns:
    - Generally considered safe and non-comedogenic; experts agree it is hypoallergenic with minimal risk of irritation.
    - It won't trap dirt or cause acne for most people. Excessive occlusivity (very thick films) might rarely irritate extremely sensitive skin, but no significant toxic effects are known.
"en:xanthan_gum":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is: A natural polysaccharide (microbial gum) used as a thickener, stabilizer, and emulsifier in formulations. It improves texture and consistency, giving creams and gels a smooth, uniform feel, and can help lock in moisture on the skin:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}.
    - ***Types: Supplied as a white or off-white powder. Derived by fermentation (usually from carbohydrates like corn, soy or wheat sugars) by bacteria (Xanthomonas campestris).
    - ***Concerns: 
    - Considered hypoallergenic and very safe for skin use.
    - Rarely, individuals with severe food allergies (corn, soy, wheat) might react if the gum is not purified. Otherwise, allergic reactions are extremely rare.
"en:sodium_fluoride":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is: An inorganic fluoride salt used primarily in oral care (toothpastes, mouthwashes) for its anticaries effect. It helps remineralize tooth enamel and prevent cavities by providing fluoride ions.
    - ***Types: Other fluoride sources (e.g. sodium monofluorophosphate, stannous fluoride) exist, but sodium fluoride is a common option. It appears as a fine, white crystalline powder.
    - ***Concerns:
    - Potent in small doses but toxic if ingested in large amounts. Toothpaste containing sodium fluoride should not be swallowed; children must use only a pea-sized amount and spit out excess. Excessive ingestion can cause upset stomach or more serious toxicity. Chronic overuse (especially in children) can lead to dental fluorosis (white spots on teeth).
"en:cetyl_alcohol":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is: A long-chain (16-carbon) fatty alcohol used as an emollient, emulsifier, and thickener. It softens and smooths skin, helps stabilize creams, and imparts a creamy texture.
    - ***Types: Can be derived from natural fats (e.g. coconut, palm) or made synthetically; both sources yield similar cetyl alcohol. It is a solid waxy substance at room temperature.
    - ***Concerns:
    - Generally safe and non-irritating. Reports of irritation are usually due to impurities, not cetyl alcohol itself.
    - It is not the same as simple drying alcohols (like ethanol) and is well-tolerated by most skin types.
"en:cocamidopropyl_betaine":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is: A gentle amphoteric surfactant (foaming cleanser) derived from coconut oil. It acts like mild soap, reducing water's surface tension to help lift dirt and oils; often used in shampoos, body washes, and wipes.
    - ***Types: Often found in solution form in cleansers and bath products. It is produced from coconut fatty acids and DMAPA (dimethylaminopropylamine) in manufacturing.
    - ***Concerns:
    - Can cause skin irritation or allergic contact dermatitis in susceptible individuals.
    - Reactions are sometimes due to impurities (residual amidoamine or DMAPA) from its manufacture.
    - Most people tolerate it fine, but those with sensitive skin or a history of surfactant allergies should patch-test products.
"en:disodium_edta":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is: The disodium salt of EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), a chelating agent that binds metal ions. It prevents metals (like calcium, magnesium, iron) from destabilizing or spoiling formulations, thus preserving color, fragrance and efficacy.
    - ***Types: Other EDTA salts include tetrasodium and calcium disodium EDTA; disodium EDTA is soluble in water and commonly used for neutral to slightly acidic formulas (pH <7).
    - ***Concerns:
    - Considered safe and non-irritating at typical use levels.
    - It has negligible systemic absorption.
    - One concern is its environmental persistence (poorly biodegradable), but direct effects on skin are minimal. Rarely, very high concentrations near eyes could irritate.
"en:fragrance":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is: A complex blend of natural essential oils or synthetic aroma compounds added to cosmetics to give them a pleasant scent. The term “fragrance” or “parfum” on a label covers proprietary mixtures of many aroma chemicals.
    - ***Types: Ranges from single natural extracts (lavender oil, citrus oil, etc.) to multicomponent synthetic perfume blends. Companies may use hundreds of chemicals to achieve a fragrance.
    - ***Concerns:
    - Fragrances are among the most common skin sensitizers.
    - Many fragrance ingredients (natural or synthetic) can cause allergies or irritation. EU regulations require listing common allergens if above trace levels. Because formulations are proprietary, the risk of unidentified allergens is high.
"en:phenoxyethanol":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is: A broad-spectrum antimicrobial preservative. It protects products from bacteria and yeast (especially gram-negative) at low concentrations (typically ≤1%), extending shelf life of cosmetics and skincare products:contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}.
    - ***Types: Pure phenoxyethanol is a clear liquid; often used alone or with other preservatives (e.g. as a booster with parabens or organic acids).
    - ***Concerns:
    - Generally safe at approved use levels (≤1%). The EU and experts consider it non-toxic at these concentrations.
    - Rarely, some individuals may experience irritation or allergic reaction. High doses (far above cosmetic use) have shown toxicity in animal studies, but normal use poses minimal risk.
"en:sodium_hydroxide":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is: A strong inorganic base (caustic soda) used to adjust and stabilize the pH of cosmetic formulations. It neutralizes acids and helps create soap by saponifying fats. 
    - ***Types: Typically used as a water solution or solid flakes. Also known as “lye.” In hair care, higher-strength solutions are used in relaxers and permanent waves.
    - ***Concerns: Highly corrosive in concentrated form. In cosmetics, it is used only in very small amounts (generally <2% in rinse-off, <0.25% in leave-on products).
    - At high concentrations it can cause chemical burns on skin and eyes.
    - Products should be formulated carefully; inadvertent exposure to raw sodium hydroxide can be dangerous, so it's never used neat.
"en:ethylhexylglycerin":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is: A glyceryl ether (an 8-carbon alkyl glyceryl compound) used as a mild preservative booster and skin-conditioning agent. It has weak antimicrobial properties and is often used to enhance other preservatives (like phenoxyethanol), while also acting as a gentle humectant.
    - ***Types: Only one form (3-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,2-propanediol). Usually added in solution at low percentages (0.5-1.0%).
    - ***Concerns:
    - Generally well-tolerated at normal levels. It is a very weak allergen, with rare cases of contact allergy (~0.25% positive patch tests).
    - May cause mild irritation in very sensitive skin or eyes, but overall toxicity is low.
"en:glyceryl_stearate":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is: An ester formed from glycerin and stearic acid, acting as an emulsifier and emollient. It helps blend oil and water in creams/lotions and leaves skin feeling soft; also adds a creamy texture and helps stabilize emulsions.
    - ***Types: Often sold as Glyceryl Stearate SE (self-emulsifying, neutralized) or simply glyceryl stearate. Natural sources include palm or coconut oil combined with glycerin.
    - ***Concerns:
    - Considered very safe.
    - It is non-comedogenic and rarely causes irritation. In rare cases, individuals may have personal sensitivity, but no systemic toxicity is known.
"en:hexyl_cinnamal":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is: A fragrance ingredient with a sweet floral scent (reminiscent of jasmine or ylang-ylang), used to scent personal care products. It's chemically an aldehyde derivative and can be found in natural extracts (e.g. from jasmine) or made synthetically.
    - ***Types: Also known as alpha-hexyl cinnamaldehyde. No widely used variants beyond its enantiomeric forms.
    - ***Concerns:
    - A known skin allergen. The EU requires it to be listed if above very low levels (0.001% in leave-ons) due to frequent allergic reactions.
    - It can cause contact dermatitis in susceptible people.
"en:linalool":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is: A naturally occurring terpene alcohol found in many flowers and spice plants (like lavender, basil, and coriander) and used as a perfume ingredient for a floral scent. It's a common fragrance component in many products.
    - ***Types: Can occur as two enantiomers (l- and d-linalool) or as a racemic mix (dl-linalool). It is often used as an isolated ingredient rather than as an essential oil.
    - ***Concerns:
    - Pure linalool is a weak allergen, but it readily oxidizes in air. The oxidation products are potent skin sensitizers.
    - Therefore, if linalool-containing products are not properly preserved, they can cause allergic contact dermatitis.
"en:limonene":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is: A terpene hydrocarbon with a fresh citrus scent, commonly obtained from orange or lemon peel oil. Used in cosmetics for fragrance (and occasionally as a solvent in cleaning formulations).
    - ***Types: Exists as two enantiomers: d-limonene (most common, smells like oranges) and l-limonene (pine- or turpentine-like). d-Limonene is by far more widely used.
    - ***Concerns:
    - Relatively inert itself, but it oxidizes quickly in air to form hydroperoxides. These oxidation products are strong contact allergens.
    - Thus oxidized limonene can cause skin sensitization and irritation.
"en:coumarin":
  content: |-
    - ***What it is: A fragrant organic compound with a sweet, vanilla-like scent (often described as almondy or hay-like), originally isolated from tonka beans. Used in perfumery and cosmetic products to add sweet herbal notes.
    - ***Types: Naturally found in some plants (tonka bean, cinnamon), but typically used in synthetic form for consistency.
    - ***Concerns: It is a known allergenic fragrance (one of the EU's 26 listed allergens). EU rules require it to be declared in products at low levels (≥0.001% in leave-ons).
    - It may cause allergic skin reactions.
    - (Coumarin is also toxic if ingested and banned as a food flavor in many countries.)
