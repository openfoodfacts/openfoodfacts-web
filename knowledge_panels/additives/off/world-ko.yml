    Potassium sorbate (E202) is a synthetic food preservative commonly used
    to extend the shelf life of various food products.

    It works by inhibiting the growth of molds, yeast, and some bacteria,
    preventing spoilage. When added to foods, it helps maintain their
    freshness and quality.

    Some studies have shown that when combined with nitrites, potassium
    sorbate have genotoxic activity in vitro. However, potassium sorbate is
    generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by regulatory authorities.

    Carrageenan (E407), derived from red seaweed, is widely employed in the
    food industry as a gelling, thickening, and stabilizing agent, notably in
    dairy and meat products.

    It can exist in various forms, each imparting distinct textural
    properties to food.

    However, its degraded form, often referred to as poligeenan, **has raised
    health concerns** due to its potential inflammatory effects and its
    classification as a **possible human carcinogen (Group 2B)** by the
    International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

    Nevertheless, food-grade carrageenan has been deemed safe by various
    regulatory bodies when consumed in amounts typically found in food.

    Pectins (E440) are natural carbohydrates, predominantly found in fruits,
    that act as gelling agents in the food industry, creating the desirable
    jelly-like texture in jams, jellies, and marmalades.

    Pectins stabilize and thicken various food products, such as desserts,
    confectioneries, and beverages, ensuring a uniform consistency and
    quality.

    Recognized as safe by various health authorities, pectins have been
    widely used without notable adverse effects when consumed in typical
    dietary amounts.

    Diphosphates (E450) are food additives often utilized to modify the
    texture of products, acting as leavening agents in baking and preventing
    the coagulation of canned food.

    These salts can stabilize whipped cream and are also found in powdered
    products to maintain their flow properties. They are commonly present in
    baked goods, processed meats, and soft drinks.

    Derived from phosphoric acid, **they're part of our daily phosphate
    intake, which often surpasses recommended levels** due to the prevalence
    of phosphates in processed foods and drinks.

    Excessive phosphate consumption is linked to health issues, such as
    **impaired kidney function** and **weakened bone health**. Though diphosphates
    are generally regarded as safe when consumed within established
    acceptable daily intakes, it's imperative to monitor overall phosphate
    consumption to maintain optimal health.

    Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (E471), are food additives
    commonly used as emulsifiers in various processed foods.

    These compounds consist of glycerol molecules linked to one or two
    fatty acid chains, which help stabilize and blend water and oil-based
    ingredients. E471 enhances the texture and shelf life of products
    like margarine, baked goods, and ice cream, ensuring a smooth and
    consistent texture.

    It is generally considered safe for consumption within established
    regulatory limits.

    Sodium carbonates (E500) are compounds commonly used in food preparation
    as leavening agents, helping baked goods rise by releasing carbon dioxide
    when they interact with acids.

    Often found in baking soda, they regulate the pH of food, preventing it
    from becoming too acidic or too alkaline. In the culinary world, sodium
    carbonates can also enhance the texture and structure of foods, such as
    noodles, by modifying the gluten network.

    Generally recognized as safe, sodium carbonates are non-toxic when
    consumed in typical amounts found in food.

    Sodium hydrogen carbonate, also known as E500ii, is a food additive
    commonly used as a leavening agent.

    When added to recipes, it releases carbon dioxide gas upon exposure to
    heat or acids, causing dough to rise and resulting in a light, fluffy
    texture in baked goods.

    It is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by regulatory authorities when
    used in appropriate quantities and poses no significant health risks when
    consumed in typical food applications.

    Cochineal extract or carmine (E120) is a natural red colorant derived
    from the dried bodies of the female cochineal insect.

    It is widely used to impart a pink, red, or purple hue to various food
    and beverage products, including yogurts, ice creams, confectionery, and
    fruit juices.

    Although it is a natural additive, E120 is known to cause **severe
    allergic reactions**, including anaphylaxis, in some individuals. It is
    also **not suitable for vegetarians or vegans** due to its insect
    origin.

    Sodium nitrite (E250) is a salt used for curing and preserving meat
    products.

    It plays a critical role in preventing the growth of Clostridium
    botulinum, the bacterium responsible for botulism, in cured meats like
    bacon, ham, and sausages. It also provides the characteristic pink color
    and flavor.

    However, nitrites can react with amines in the stomach to form
    nitrosamines, which are **potent carcinogens**. High intake of processed
    meats containing nitrites is associated with an **increased risk of
    colorectal cancer**. Regulatory bodies have set strict limits on its
    use in food.

    Monosodium glutamate (MSG), or E621, is the sodium salt of glutamic
    acid, an amino acid found naturally in many foods.

    It is widely used as a flavor enhancer to provide an "umami" or savory
    taste to a variety of processed foods, including soups, snack chips, and
    frozen meals.

    MSG is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by food authorities. However,
    some people report sensitivity to MSG, experiencing short-term symptoms
    like headaches and flushing, though **scientific studies have not shown a
    consistent link**.

    Aspartame (E951) is a low-calorie artificial sweetener composed of two
    amino acids.

    It is used as a sugar substitute in thousands of "sugar-free" or "diet"
    products, such as carbonated soft drinks, chewing gum, yogurts, and
    tabletop sweeteners, to provide sweetness without the calories of sugar.

    Despite being one of the most rigorously tested food additives, its
    safety remains controversial. While major regulatory bodies like the FDA
    and EFSA deem it safe for the general public, the IARC has classified it
    as **"possibly carcinogenic to humans" (Group 2B)**. It must also be
    avoided by individuals with the genetic condition phenylketonuria (PKU).
