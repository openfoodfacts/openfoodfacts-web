    Potassium sorbate (E202) is a synthetic food preservative commonly used
    to extend the shelf life of various food products.

    It works by inhibiting the growth of molds, yeast, and some bacteria,
    preventing spoilage. When added to foods, it helps maintain their
    freshness and quality.

    Some studies have shown that when combined with nitrites, potassium
    sorbate have genotoxic activity in vitro. However, potassium sorbate is
    generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by regulatory authorities.

    Citric acid is a natural organic acid found in citrus fruits such as
    lemons, oranges, and limes.

    It is widely used in the food industry as a flavor enhancer, acidulant,
    and preservative due to its tart and refreshing taste.

    Citric acid is safe for consumption when used in moderation and is
    considered a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) food additive by
    regulatory agencies worldwide.

    Carrageenan (E407), derived from red seaweed, is widely employed in the
    food industry as a gelling, thickening, and stabilizing agent, notably in
    dairy and meat products.

    It can exist in various forms, each imparting distinct textural
    properties to food.

    However, its degraded form, often referred to as poligeenan, **has raised
    health concerns** due to its potential inflammatory effects and its
    classification as a **possible human carcinogen (Group 2B)** by the
    International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

    Nevertheless, food-grade carrageenan has been deemed safe by various
    regulatory bodies when consumed in amounts typically found in food.

    Guar gum (E412) is a natural food additive derived from guar beans.

    This white, odorless powder is valued for its remarkable thickening and
    stabilizing properties, making it a common ingredient in various food
    products, including sauces, dressings, and ice creams.

    When used in moderation, guar gum is considered safe for consumption,
    with no known adverse health effects.

    Xanthan gum (E415) is a natural polysaccharide derived from fermented
    sugars, often used in the food industry as a thickening and stabilizing
    agent.

    This versatile food additive enhances texture and prevents ingredient
    separation in a wide range of products, including salad dressings,
    sauces, and gluten-free baked goods.

    It is considered safe for consumption even at high intake amounts.

    Pectins (E440) are natural carbohydrates, predominantly found in fruits,
    that act as gelling agents in the food industry, creating the desirable
    jelly-like texture in jams, jellies, and marmalades.

    Pectins stabilize and thicken various food products, such as desserts,
    confectioneries, and beverages, ensuring a uniform consistency and
    quality.

    Recognized as safe by various health authorities, pectins have been
    widely used without notable adverse effects when consumed in typical
    dietary amounts.

    Diphosphates (E450) are food additives often utilized to modify the
    texture of products, acting as leavening agents in baking and preventing
    the coagulation of canned food.

    These salts can stabilize whipped cream and are also found in powdered
    products to maintain their flow properties. They are commonly present in
    baked goods, processed meats, and soft drinks.

    Derived from phosphoric acid, **they're part of our daily phosphate
    intake, which often surpasses recommended levels** due to the prevalence
    of phosphates in processed foods and drinks.

    Excessive phosphate consumption is linked to health issues, such as
    **impaired kidney function** and **weakened bone health**. Though diphosphates
    are generally regarded as safe when consumed within established
    acceptable daily intakes, it's imperative to monitor overall phosphate
    consumption to maintain optimal health.

    Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (E471), are food additives
    commonly used as emulsifiers in various processed foods.

    These compounds consist of glycerol molecules linked to one or two
    fatty acid chains, which help stabilize and blend water and oil-based
    ingredients. E471 enhances the texture and shelf life of products
    like margarine, baked goods, and ice cream, ensuring a smooth and
    consistent texture.

    It is generally considered safe for consumption within established
    regulatory limits.

    Sodium carbonates (E500) are compounds commonly used in food preparation
    as leavening agents, helping baked goods rise by releasing carbon dioxide
    when they interact with acids.

    Often found in baking soda, they regulate the pH of food, preventing it
    from becoming too acidic or too alkaline. In the culinary world, sodium
    carbonates can also enhance the texture and structure of foods, such as
    noodles, by modifying the gluten network.

    Generally recognized as safe, sodium carbonates are non-toxic when
    consumed in typical amounts found in food.

    Sodium hydrogen carbonate, also known as E500ii, is a food additive
    commonly used as a leavening agent.

    When added to recipes, it releases carbon dioxide gas upon exposure to
    heat or acids, causing dough to rise and resulting in a light, fluffy
    texture in baked goods.

    It is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by regulatory authorities when
    used in appropriate quantities and poses no significant health risks when
    consumed in typical food applications.

    Tartrazin (E102) je sintetička limun žuta azo boja koja se koristi kao prehrambena
    boja.

    Nalazi se u širokom rasponu proizvoda kao što su bezalkoholna pića, deserti,
    bomboni i grickalice kako bi im dao živopisan žuti izgled.

    Iako ga je odobrilo mnogo regulatornih agencija, tartrazin je povezan
    s **alergijskim reakcijama**, poput osipa, kod malog dijela
    populacije. Neke studije također sugeriraju vezu s **povećanom
    hiperaktivnošću kod djece**, posebno kada se konzumira s drugim
    aditivima poput benzoata.

    Ekstrakt košenile ili karmin (E120) je prirodno crveno bojilo dobiveno
    iz osušenih tijela ženke košenile.

    Široko se koristi za davanje ružičaste, crvene ili ljubičaste nijanse raznim prehrambenim
    proizvodima i pićima, uključujući jogurte, sladolede, slatkiše i
    voćne sokove.

    Iako je prirodni aditiv, poznato je da E120 uzrokuje **teške
    alergijske reakcije**, uključujući anafilaksiju, kod nekih osoba.
    Također **nije prikladan za vegetarijance ili vegane** zbog svog insektnog
    podrijetla.

    Natrijev nitrit (E250) je sol koja se koristi za salamurenje i konzerviranje mesnih
    proizvoda.

    Igra ključnu ulogu u sprječavanju rasta Clostridium
    botulinum, bakterije odgovorne za botulizam, u suhomesnatim proizvodima poput
    slanine, šunke i kobasica. Također daje karakterističnu ružičastu boju
    i okus.

    Međutim, nitriti mogu reagirati s aminima u želucu stvarajući
    nitrozamine, koji su **potentni kancerogeni**. Visok unos prerađenog
    mesa koje sadrži nitrite povezan je s **povećanim rizikom od
    kolorektalnog karcinoma**. Regulatorna tijela postavila su stroga ograničenja na njegovu
    upotrebu u hrani.

    Mononatrijev glutamat (MSG), ili E621, je natrijeva sol glutaminske
    kiseline, aminokiseline koja se prirodno nalazi u mnogim namirnicama.

    Široko se koristi kao pojačivač okusa kako bi se raznim prerađenim namirnicama, uključujući juhe, čips i
    smrznute obroke, dao "umami" ili slani
    okus.

    MSG je općenito priznat kao siguran (GRAS) od strane tijela za hranu. Međutim,
    neke osobe prijavljuju osjetljivost na MSG, doživljavajući kratkotrajne simptome
    poput glavobolje i crvenila, iako **znanstvene studije nisu pokazale
    dosljednu vezu**.

    Aspartam (E951) je niskokalorično umjetno sladilo sastavljeno od dvije
    aminokiseline.

    Koristi se kao zamjena za šećer u tisućama "bez šećera" ili "dijetalnih"
    proizvoda, kao što su gazirana bezalkoholna pića, žvakaće gume, jogurti i
    tabletna sladila, kako bi se osigurala slatkoća bez kalorija šećera.

    Unatoč tome što je jedan od najstrožih testiranih aditiva u hrani, njegova
    sigurnost ostaje kontroverzna. Dok ga glavna regulatorna tijela poput FDA
    i EFSA-e smatraju sigurnim za širu javnost, IARC ga je klasificirao
    kao **"moguće kancerogen za ljude" (Skupina 2B)**. Također ga moraju
    izbjegavati osobe s genetskim stanjem fenilketonurije (PKU).
