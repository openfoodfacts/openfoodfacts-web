    Potassium sorbate (E202) is a synthetic food preservative commonly used
    to extend the shelf life of various food products.

    It works by inhibiting the growth of molds, yeast, and some bacteria,
    preventing spoilage. When added to foods, it helps maintain their
    freshness and quality.

    Some studies have shown that when combined with nitrites, potassium
    sorbate have genotoxic activity in vitro. However, potassium sorbate is
    generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by regulatory authorities.

    Carrageenan (E407), derived from red seaweed, is widely employed in the
    food industry as a gelling, thickening, and stabilizing agent, notably in
    dairy and meat products.

    It can exist in various forms, each imparting distinct textural
    properties to food.

    However, its degraded form, often referred to as poligeenan, **has raised
    health concerns** due to its potential inflammatory effects and its
    classification as a **possible human carcinogen (Group 2B)** by the
    International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

    Nevertheless, food-grade carrageenan has been deemed safe by various
    regulatory bodies when consumed in amounts typically found in food.

    Pectins (E440) are natural carbohydrates, predominantly found in fruits,
    that act as gelling agents in the food industry, creating the desirable
    jelly-like texture in jams, jellies, and marmalades.

    Pectins stabilize and thicken various food products, such as desserts,
    confectioneries, and beverages, ensuring a uniform consistency and
    quality.

    Recognized as safe by various health authorities, pectins have been
    widely used without notable adverse effects when consumed in typical

    Diphosphates (E450) are food additives often utilized to modify the
    texture of products, acting as leavening agents in baking and preventing
    the coagulation of canned food.

    These salts can stabilize whipped cream and are also found in powdered
    products to maintain their flow properties. They are commonly present in
    baked goods, processed meats, and soft drinks.

    Derived from phosphoric acid, **they're part of our daily phosphate
    intake, which often surpasses recommended levels** due to the prevalence
    of phosphates in processed foods and drinks.

    Excessive phosphate consumption is linked to health issues, such as
    **impaired kidney function** and **weakened bone health**. Though diphosphates
    are generally regarded as safe when consumed within established
    acceptable daily intakes, it's imperative to monitor overall phosphate
    consumption to maintain optimal health.

    Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (E471), are food additives
    commonly used as emulsifiers in various processed foods.

    These compounds consist of glycerol molecules linked to one or two
    fatty acid chains, which help stabilize and blend water and oil-based
    ingredients. E471 enhances the texture and shelf life of products
    like margarine, baked goods, and ice cream, ensuring a smooth and
    consistent texture.

    It is generally considered safe for consumption within established
    regulatory limits.

    Sodium carbonates (E500) are compounds commonly used in food preparation
    as leavening agents, helping baked goods rise by releasing carbon dioxide
    when they interact with acids.

    Often found in baking soda, they regulate the pH of food, preventing it
    from becoming too acidic or too alkaline. In the culinary world, sodium
    carbonates can also enhance the texture and structure of foods, such as
    noodles, by modifying the gluten network.

    Generally recognized as safe, sodium carbonates are non-toxic when
    consumed in typical amounts found in food.

    Sodium hydrogen carbonate, also known as E500ii, is a food additive
    commonly used as a leavening agent.

    When added to recipes, it releases carbon dioxide gas upon exposure to
    heat or acids, causing dough to rise and resulting in a light, fluffy
    texture in baked goods.

    It is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by regulatory authorities when
    used in appropriate quantities and poses no significant health risks when
    consumed in typical food applications.

    Ang Tartrazine (E102) ay isang sintetikong lemon-yellow na azo dye na ginagamit bilang pangkulay ng pagkain
    .

    Ito ay matatagpuan sa malawak na hanay ng mga produkto tulad ng mga soft drink, dessert,
    candies, at meryenda na pagkain upang bigyan sila ng makulay na dilaw na hitsura.

    Habang inaprubahan ng maraming ahensya ng regulasyon, ang tartrazine ay iniugnay
    sa **mga reaksiyong alerdyi**, tulad ng mga pantal, sa isang maliit na bahagi ng
    populasyon. Ang ilang pag-aaral ay nagmungkahi din ng isang link sa **tumaas na
    hyperactivity sa mga bata**, lalo na kapag iniinom kasama ng iba pang
    additives tulad ng benzoates.

    at mga produktong inumin, kabilang ang mga yogurt, ice cream, confectionery, at
    fruit juice.

    Bagama't ito ay isang natural na additive, ang E120 ay kilala na nagdudulot ng **malubhang

    Ang sodium nitrite (E250) ay isang asin na ginagamit para sa paggamot at pag-iimbak ng karne
    mga produkto.

    Ito ay gumaganap ng isang kritikal na papel sa pagpigil sa paglaki ng Clostridium
    botulinum, ang bacterium na responsable para sa botulism, sa mga cured meat tulad ng
    bacon, ham, at sausages. Nagbibigay din ito ng katangiang kulay rosas na
    at lasa.

    Gayunpaman, ang mga nitrite ay maaaring tumugon sa mga amine sa tiyan upang bumuo ng
    nitrosamines, na **makapangyarihang mga carcinogens**. Ang mataas na paggamit ng naprosesong
    karne na naglalaman ng nitrite ay nauugnay sa isang **tumaas na panganib ng
    colorectal cancer**. Ang mga regulatory body ay nagtakda ng mahigpit na limitasyon sa paggamit nito sa

    Ang Monosodium glutamate (MSG), o E621, ay ang sodium salt ng glutamic
    acid, isang amino acid na natural na matatagpuan sa maraming pagkain.

    Ito ay malawakang ginagamit bilang pampalasa upang magbigay ng "umami" o malasang
    lasa sa iba't ibang naprosesong pagkain, kabilang ang mga sopas, snack chips, at
    frozen na pagkain.

    Ang MSG ay karaniwang kinikilala bilang ligtas (GRAS) ng mga awtoridad sa pagkain. Gayunpaman,
    ang ilang mga tao ay nag-uulat ng pagiging sensitibo sa MSG, na nakakaranas ng mga panandaliang sintomas
    tulad ng pananakit ng ulo at pamumula, kahit na **ang mga siyentipikong pag-aaral ay hindi nagpapakita ng

    Ang Aspartame (E951) ay isang mababang-calorie na artipisyal na pangpatamis na binubuo ng dalawang
    amino acid.

    Ginagamit ito bilang pamalit sa asukal sa libu-libong "sugar-free" o "diet"
    mga produkto, gaya ng carbonated soft drink, chewing gum, yogurt, at
    tabletop sweetener, upang magbigay ng tamis na walang mga calorie ng asukal.

    Sa kabila ng pagiging isa sa mga pinaka-mahigpit na nasubok na food additives, ang kaligtasan nito
    ay nananatiling kontrobersyal. Bagama't itinuturing ng mga pangunahing regulatory body tulad ng FDA
    at EFSA na ligtas ito para sa pangkalahatang publiko, inuri ito ng IARC
    bilang **"posibleng carcinogenic sa mga tao" (Group 2B)**. Dapat din itong
    iwasan ng mga indibidwal na may genetic condition na phenylketonuria (PKU).
