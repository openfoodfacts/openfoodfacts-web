    Potassium sorbate (E202) is a synthetic food preservative commonly used
    to extend the shelf life of various food products.

    It works by inhibiting the growth of molds, yeast, and some bacteria,
    preventing spoilage. When added to foods, it helps maintain their
    freshness and quality.

    Some studies have shown that when combined with nitrites, potassium
    sorbate have genotoxic activity in vitro. However, potassium sorbate is
    generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by regulatory authorities.

    Carrageenan (E407), derived from red seaweed, is widely employed in the
    food industry as a gelling, thickening, and stabilizing agent, notably in
    dairy and meat products.

    It can exist in various forms, each imparting distinct textural
    properties to food.

    However, its degraded form, often referred to as poligeenan, **has raised
    health concerns** due to its potential inflammatory effects and its
    classification as a **possible human carcinogen (Group 2B)** by the
    International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

    Nevertheless, food-grade carrageenan has been deemed safe by various
    regulatory bodies when consumed in amounts typically found in food.

    Diphosphates (E450) are food additives often utilized to modify the
    texture of products, acting as leavening agents in baking and preventing
    the coagulation of canned food.

    These salts can stabilize whipped cream and are also found in powdered
    products to maintain their flow properties. They are commonly present in
    baked goods, processed meats, and soft drinks.

    Derived from phosphoric acid, **they're part of our daily phosphate
    intake, which often surpasses recommended levels** due to the prevalence
    of phosphates in processed foods and drinks.

    Excessive phosphate consumption is linked to health issues, such as
    **impaired kidney function** and **weakened bone health**. Though diphosphates
    are generally regarded as safe when consumed within established
    acceptable daily intakes, it's imperative to monitor overall phosphate
    consumption to maintain optimal health.

    Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (E471), are food additives
    commonly used as emulsifiers in various processed foods.

    These compounds consist of glycerol molecules linked to one or two
    fatty acid chains, which help stabilize and blend water and oil-based
    ingredients. E471 enhances the texture and shelf life of products
    like margarine, baked goods, and ice cream, ensuring a smooth and
    consistent texture.

    It is generally considered safe for consumption within established
    regulatory limits.

    Sodium carbonates (E500) are compounds commonly used in food preparation
    as leavening agents, helping baked goods rise by releasing carbon dioxide
    when they interact with acids.

    Often found in baking soda, they regulate the pH of food, preventing it
    from becoming too acidic or too alkaline. In the culinary world, sodium
    carbonates can also enhance the texture and structure of foods, such as
    noodles, by modifying the gluten network.

    Generally recognized as safe, sodium carbonates are non-toxic when
    consumed in typical amounts found in food.

    Sodium hydrogen carbonate, also known as E500ii, is a food additive
    commonly used as a leavening agent.

    When added to recipes, it releases carbon dioxide gas upon exposure to
    heat or acids, causing dough to rise and resulting in a light, fluffy
    texture in baked goods.

    It is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by regulatory authorities when
    used in appropriate quantities and poses no significant health risks when
    consumed in typical food applications.

    Tartrazine (E102) is a synthetic lemon-yellow azo dye used as a food
    coloring.

    It is found in a wide range of products such as soft drinks, desserts,
    candies, and snack foods to give them a vibrant yellow appearance.

    While approved by many regulatory agencies, tartrazine has been linked
    to **allergic reactions**, such as hives, in a small portion of the
    population. Some studies have also suggested a link to **increased
    hyperactivity in children**, particularly when consumed with other
    additives like benzoates.

    and beverage products, including yogurts, ice creams, confectionery, and
    fruit juices.

    Although it is a natural additive, E120 is known to cause **severe
    allergic reactions**, including anaphylaxis, in some individuals. It is
    also **not suitable for vegetarians or vegans** due to its insect
    origin.

    Aspartame (E951) is a low-calorie artificial sweetener composed of two
    amino acids.

    It is used as a sugar substitute in thousands of "sugar-free" or "diet"
    products, such as carbonated soft drinks, chewing gum, yogurts, and
    tabletop sweeteners, to provide sweetness without the calories of sugar.

    Despite being one of the most rigorously tested food additives, its
    safety remains controversial. While major regulatory bodies like the FDA
    and EFSA deem it safe for the general public, the IARC has classified it
    as **"possibly carcinogenic to humans" (Group 2B)**. It must also be
    avoided by individuals with the genetic condition phenylketonuria (PKU).
