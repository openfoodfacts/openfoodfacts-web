          Citric acid is a natural organic acid found in citrus fruits such as
          lemons, oranges, and limes.

          It is widely used in the food industry as a flavor enhancer, acidulant,
          and preservative due to its tart and refreshing taste.

          Citric acid is safe for consumption when used in moderation and is
          considered a generally recognized as safe (GRAS) food additive by
          regulatory agencies worldwide.

          Sodium carbonates (E500) are compounds commonly used in food preparation
          as leavening agents, helping baked goods rise by releasing carbon dioxide
          when they interact with acids.

          Often found in baking soda, they regulate the pH of food, preventing it
          from becoming too acidic or too alkaline. In the culinary world, sodium
          carbonates can also enhance the texture and structure of foods, such as
          noodles, by modifying the gluten network.

          Generally recognized as safe, sodium carbonates are non-toxic when
          consumed in typical amounts found in food.

          Xanthan gum (E415) is a natural polysaccharide derived from fermented
          sugars, often used in the food industry as a thickening and stabilizing
          agent.

          This versatile food additive enhances texture and prevents ingredient
          separation in a wide range of products, including salad dressings,
          sauces, and gluten-free baked goods.

          It is considered safe for consumption even at high intake amounts.

          Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (E471), are food additives
          commonly used as emulsifiers in various processed foods.

          These compounds consist of glycerol molecules linked to one or two
          fatty acid chains, which help stabilize and blend water and oil-based
          ingredients. E471 enhances the texture and shelf life of products
          like margarine, baked goods, and ice cream, ensuring a smooth and
          consistent texture.

          It is generally considered safe for consumption within established
          regulatory limits.

          Sodium hydrogen carbonate, also known as E500ii, is a food additive
          commonly used as a leavening agent.

          When added to recipes, it releases carbon dioxide gas upon exposure to
          heat or acids, causing dough to rise and resulting in a light, fluffy
          texture in baked goods.

          It is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by regulatory authorities when
          used in appropriate quantities and poses no significant health risks when
          consumed in typical food applications.

          Guar gum (E412) is a natural food additive derived from guar beans.

          This white, odorless powder is valued for its remarkable thickening and
          stabilizing properties, making it a common ingredient in various food
          products, including sauces, dressings, and ice creams.

          When used in moderation, guar gum is considered safe for consumption,
          with no known adverse health effects.

          Potassium sorbate (E202) is a synthetic food preservative commonly used
          to extend the shelf life of various food products.

          It works by inhibiting the growth of molds, yeast, and some bacteria,
          preventing spoilage. When added to foods, it helps maintain their
          freshness and quality.

          Some studies have shown that when combined with nitrites, potassium
          sorbate have genotoxic activity in vitro. However, potassium sorbate is
          generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by regulatory authorities.

          Diphosphates (E450) are food additives often utilized to modify the
          texture of products, acting as leavening agents in baking and preventing
          the coagulation of canned food.

          These salts can stabilize whipped cream and are also found in powdered
          products to maintain their flow properties. They are commonly present in
          baked goods, processed meats, and soft drinks.

          Derived from phosphoric acid, **they're part of our daily phosphate
          intake, which often surpasses recommended levels** due to the prevalence
          of phosphates in processed foods and drinks.

          Excessive phosphate consumption is linked to health issues, such as
          **impaired kidney function** and **weakened bone health**. Though diphosphates
          are generally regarded as safe when consumed within established
          acceptable daily intakes, it's imperative to monitor overall phosphate
          consumption to maintain optimal health.

          Carrageenan (E407), derived from red seaweed, is widely employed in the
          food industry as a gelling, thickening, and stabilizing agent, notably in
          dairy and meat products.

          It can exist in various forms, each imparting distinct textural
          properties to food.

          However, its degraded form, often referred to as poligeenan, **has raised
          health concerns** due to its potential inflammatory effects and its
          classification as a **possible human carcinogen (Group 2B)** by the
          International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

          Nevertheless, food-grade carrageenan has been deemed safe by various
          regulatory bodies when consumed in amounts typically found in food.

          Pectins (E440) are natural carbohydrates, predominantly found in fruits,
          that act as gelling agents in the food industry, creating the desirable
          jelly-like texture in jams, jellies, and marmalades.

          Pectins stabilize and thicken various food products, such as desserts,
          confectioneries, and beverages, ensuring a uniform consistency and
          quality.

          Recognized as safe by various health authorities, pectins have been
          widely used without notable adverse effects when consumed in typical
          dietary amounts.
