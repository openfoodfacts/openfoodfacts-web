    - Iron is a mineral that helps (among other things) carry oxygen throughout your body. Iron deficiency can cause anemia, fatigue, and limited body functions. Lean meats, poultry, fish, legumes, and dark green leafy vegetables are good sources of iron. Pairing them with foods rich in vitamin C can help your body absorb the iron.
