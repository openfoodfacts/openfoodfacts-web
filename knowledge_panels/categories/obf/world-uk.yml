    - ***What it is: Sun creams, also known as sunscreens, are topical products designed to protect the skin from the harmful effects of the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation.  They contain specific ingredients that either absorb or reflect UV rays, preventing them from penetrating the skin and causing damage.
    - ***Types: Sun creams come in various forms, including lotions, sprays, sticks, and gels.  They are also classified by their Sun Protection Factor (SPF), which indicates how long it would take for UVB rays to redden the skin when using the product compared to how long it would take without any protection.  Broad spectrum sunscreens protect against both UVA and UVB rays.  Physical sunscreens (mineral sunscreens) contain mineral ingredients like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide that sit on top of the skin and reflect UV rays. Chemical sunscreens contain chemicals that absorb UV rays and convert them into heat, which is then released from the skin.
    - ***Concerns:
    - **Chemical Filters:** Some chemical sunscreen filters have raised concerns about potential hormone disruption and skin irritation.  Research is ongoing to fully understand the long-term effects of these chemicals.  Some specific chemicals have also been banned in certain locations because of their environmental impact on coral reefs.
    - **Nanoparticles:**  There are concerns about the use of nanoparticles in mineral sunscreens. While generally considered safe, some studies suggest potential risks associated with their penetration into the skin.  Regulations regarding nanoparticle usage in sunscreens vary.
    - **Environmental Impact:** The ingredients in some sunscreens, particularly chemical filters, can harm aquatic ecosystems, especially coral reefs.  This has led to the development of "reef-safe" or "reef-friendly" sunscreens that avoid these harmful chemicals.
    - **Efficacy:**  Sunscreen efficacy depends on proper application.  Using too little sunscreen or not reapplying it frequently enough, especially after swimming or sweating, can significantly reduce its protective effect.
    - **Allergic Reactions:**  Some individuals may experience allergic reactions or skin irritation from certain sunscreen ingredients.  Patch testing before widespread use is recommended, especially for sensitive skin.
    - **False Sense of Security:**  Sunscreen should not be relied upon as the sole method of sun protection.  It's important to also seek shade, wear protective clothing, and limit sun exposure during peak hours.
