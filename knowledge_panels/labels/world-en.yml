    - ***What it is:*** The official organic certification logo of the European Union, often called the "Euro-leaf". It is mandatory for pre-packaged organic food produced and sold within the EU that meets the required standards.
    - ***What it guarantees:***
        - At least 95% of the product's agricultural ingredients are organic.
        - Compliance with strict EU regulations on organic production, processing, transport, and storage.
        - Prohibition of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs).
        - Restricted use of artificial fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides.
        - Adherence to specific animal welfare standards (e.g., free range, organic feed).
        - Promotion of sustainable agricultural practices and biodiversity.
        - Product traceability and regular inspections by accredited control bodies.
    - ***What it does not guarantee:***
        - That the product is 100% organic (up to 5% non-organic agricultural ingredients are allowed under strict conditions).
        - Superior nutritional quality compared to conventional products (focus is on production method).
        - That the product is locally produced (origin can be EU, non-EU, or mixed).
        - Specific social or fair trade standards (though some overlap in principles may exist).
        - Complete absence of any pesticides (certain natural pesticides are permitted).
    - ***Factoids:***
        - Use of the logo became mandatory for pre-packaged organic foods in the EU on July 1, 2010 (fully applicable from July 1, 2012).
        - The label must be accompanied by the code number of the control body and an indication of the origin of the agricultural raw materials (e.g., 'EU Agriculture', 'non-EU Agriculture', 'EU/non-EU Agriculture', or a specific country if applicable).
