    - ***What it is: Nutri-Score is a front-of-pack (FOP) nutrition labeling system designed to provide an easily understandable assessment of the overall nutritional quality of food products at a glance. It employs a five-color, five-letter scale ranging from A (dark green) for the most nutritionally favorable products to E (red) for the least favorable. Developed by the French scientific team EREN, its primary aim is to help consumers compare the nutritional value of foods within the same category and encourage healthier food choices. Originating in France, it has been officially adopted (often on a voluntary basis) by several other European countries and is used by numerous food manufacturers. This label is the Nutri-Score we detected on the pack. More at https://world.openfoodfacts.org/nutriscore

    - **What it is:** Organic labels indicate that a product is produced according to organic farming standards, which generally limit the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, genetically modified organisms, and antibiotics.
    - **Why it's used:** The label helps consumers identify products made using practices intended to reduce environmental impact, protect biodiversity, and promote animal welfare.
    - **Certification:** Organic standards and certification bodies vary by country, such as EU Organic in Europe and USDA Organic in the United States.
    - **Concerns:** Organic products are not necessarily healthier or safer than conventional products, but they aim to reduce exposure to certain synthetic chemicals.
