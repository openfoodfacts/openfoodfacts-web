# openfoodfacts-web (where the static content of openfoodfacts-server lives)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project contains static contents for [openfoodfacts product-opener project](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/).
> If you're looking for the server side version of Open Food Facts, look at product-opener instead of this repository.
> 
> Having those files in a separate project helps being more agile on translations delivery.

## âœ… How you can help
- [Writing a knowledge panel about a topic](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-web/tree/main/knowledge_panels#readme)
- [Updating a static page](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-web/tree/main/lang/en/texts)
- Reviewing and merging translations PRs on this repository
- [Volunteering on the CMS project](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/discussions/11194) to replace this very manual process.

## ðŸŽ¨ Design & User interface
- We strive to thoughtfully design every content page before we move on to implementation, so that we respect Open Food Facts' graphic charter and nascent design system, while having efficient user flows.
- [![Figma](https://img.shields.io/badge/figma-%23F24E1E.svg?logo=figma&logoColor=white) Mockups on the current app and future plans to discuss](https://www.figma.com/design/Qg9URUyrjHgYmnDHXRsTTB/Current-Website-design?m=auto&t=jNwvjRR8nIgOzzJZ-6)
- Note that @manoncorneille and @galnaf have proposed a revamp for the Discover and Contribute pages
- Note that we have a detailed mockup for the landing page that hasn't been implemented (and is a very high priority)

## Help translate

https://translate.openfoodfacts.org

## Adding a new page or updating an existing page
* Create a pull request on openfoodfacts-web with the new or modified HTML file (you can do that with the "GitHub Desktop" app if you are unfamiliar with the command line)
* Set it up for translation in the .crowdin file
* Once the pull request gets approved and merged, it will be deployed on the test server
* Deployment to production is still manual

## Requirements
* Do not hotlink ressources like images, JS or CSS. They need to be commited to the repository. Please organize resources in folders.


## Deployment

### Actual prod (no docker)

1. Move the `/lang` dir from openfoodfacts-server to openfoodfacts-resources (or maybe to make things even cleaner, to a new repo openfoodfacts-web. It's unclear if everything in openfoodfacts-resources is supposed to be available as-is on the web server).

2. Create a `/html/images/texts/` directory in openfoodfacts-web so that we can put the new images needed by texts there (we don't have to move the existing ones right away).

That way for deployment, we can just copy `/lang` and `/html` to `/srv/off/` and it will work.

### On docker

See [openfoodfacts-server:docs/how-to-guides/using-pages-from-openfoodfacts-web.md](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/blob/main/docs/how-to-guides/using-pages-from-openfoodfacts-web.md)

And that's it! That would be already be enough of a big change for a first step. Then we can have a look at what we have in `/html/` to see what we should move, one by one.
